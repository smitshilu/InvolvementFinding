hi, guys, i hope it was fun enough.
you would do this again?
right.
 and she has no related experience.
 umm, she probably has charisma. it looks like she was--she played several leads, which would be good,
 but she's--doesn't seem qualified for the job. maybe to work underneath the job we're hiring for, but.
not the job itself.
yeah.
considering that she has no experience and that the only skill that she's mentioning isn't like a high level skill, it's not very hard to keep a web site updated. especially with the software programs they have now. i think at least her compared to mark, i would say that she's not a strong candidate. umm..
... that she has no experience that's directly related to it really hurts her.
that--i did...
...notice that.
umm.
yeah.
i say i.
i think the important thing here is that we're looking for someone who's going to be a team leader, not just on the team. and to jump in only having experience as a waiter works against him.
 he--i--i really agree with jeremy that he does have the most effective resume,
 but i think he's also the only one who had a typo on it.
and i'm nitpicky about that.
 he did. umm...
underneath the first section, objective, train and management staff.
 it's little, but it's important and if this is his resume and he's got a typo on it...
...is he gonna have typos on the press releases?
team.
it was probably just...
...a miss click, 
but he didn't read over it before submitting it, which isn't very professional of him.
yes.
he seems strong, but not perfect. so maybe we could keep him as a maybe.
uh huh.
umm.
although, that did effect his schoolwork, because he has one of the lower gpas. he has a 3.3 versus 3.6, 3.8, which isn't...
well the end major's what we're concerned with though. we don't really care about what other classes he took...
it wouldn't...
...be a huge deal, but considering that creating press releases is going to be a large part of his duties, umm, i would argue that you're more careful on your resume and your cover letter than you would be just doing the 99th of 100 tasks that you've been doing for the same company.
i think you'd be more careful when you really have something to lose if you don't do well compared to when you're comfortable and in your job and in the grind.
umm.
and he has probably the most persuasive, umm, resume. he is directly, a, umm, addressing things that the job description does.
which is just a persuasive writing technique and he's the only one really showing that and hitting every point.
umm, with jacob, i just noticed a kind of weird discrepancy, there, umm, i mean, not just the typo, this is a little bit less picky than that. umm, under management training, organizational ability. he says that he performed restaurant duties ranging from busboy to night mananger.
if he has official management experience, why didn't he list that in his work experience?
that's a strange, umm, typo. it makes me wonder, was he officially a mananger ever or did he jump in one night when the manager was sick...
...and vomiting in the bathroom.
but...
...if he had management experience and this is management, he would be listing that under work experience even if it was like two months. he just wouldn't put dates. he would put mananger.
umm.
that's something he still could have listed under actual work experience, though. umm, whether you see that as being deceptive, or whether it's just not persuasive writing, or not organized writing. the way he put that together was a very poor choice considering how small his work experience is.
umm.
humm.
if this was a real situation. i think jacob's really promising, and mark's really promising. i would never hiether--hire either one of them as a manager. when one has one internship under his belt and one has been a waiter...
...during the summer.
umm, it's the specialist who lead the team, isn't it?
that's what i read.
right. we have to hire...
...one of these people.
 in real life i wouldn't.
so we have to be nitpicky, because this is what his job would be.
is to create...
...convincing documents.
his document is convincing and i think in some ways it's more convincing than mark's. i like the way it's laid out. i like how he specifically picked out the different skills that are relevant to the position.
umm, in other ways, some of it's weird. some of it's sloppy, he has a typo.
uh huh.
one thing that i--keeps jumping out at me from jacob's, is under the communications language tab, the last part there. traveled around the world with semester at cnu's, conversational and communications skills to interact with local area natives. one, it's redundant, conversational and communication skills, because when he was "communicating wi!
 th the natives"...
...only part of it was conversation, the rest of it was, a, sign language he made up on the spot.
to interact with them.
plus natives.
like.
i think it's--it's good because it shows that he can communicate with people from other cultures and that's a very good thing in advertising.
 but the way he wrote it, it was so ineffective and...
...almost offensive in a way.
he's--he's proving and disprov--he's proving and disproving his point in that...
...sentence.
uh huh.
i think that if we were going to call them in, we would probably need to have a small portfolio with both of them to see what...
...sort of...
...related documents...
...can you provide.
and look at it that way.
uh huh. i think that in some way jacob is the best candidate and the worst candidate and mark is sort of middle of the road.
he hasn't thrown all the parties, which is one thing that we do want for this job. he's supposed to manage special events and parties.
that is part of it, but at the same time, we don't feel like he's just going to totally drop the ball like jacob might.
right.
but that social skill of walking around the room and making sure everybody, that you say hi to everybody, have you heard about our new product? i feel like jacob could probably do that from, just from his description of talking to the natives.
right. i--i wasn't comparing him to a list of all the other candidates, i was just looking at, as far as our...
...characteristics for the ideal candidate...
...with the job description.
i think there's a lot of resumes being thrown away right now.
well, i only really saw one that didn't really seem to have much to offer on rosie mann. i didn't really see anything too impressive about her.
the others were, i s--saw some impressive things about.
with her, umm.
okay.
i also like how she had, umm, stress management 'cause i cannot imagine how dealing with the press would be a pretty stressful job. and she also had lots of, umm, computer skills, it looks like. she knows how to make a web page. she knows html.
i believe she has the strongest of all the gpas yet
well, it is a marketing campaign.
which would involve making a...
...leaflets and stuff and that would, umm, require some artistic skills. that to me was one of the biggest things that he had.
well...
but...
to me, the biggest weakness in mark is he--he was a psychology major, which is a nontechical degree. so, umm, he has people skills, but that psych--umm, he could very well have no computer skills at all besides, umm, ???...
but, of course, he didn't list a gpa, which would imply it probably wasn't very high.
december 2009, you know, that was only two months ago, so.
yes.
but, of course, anyone can just say anything there. i mean, a lot of people just say whatever sounds good on those things. i mean, he doesn't really say what that means. he could just be a good writer and know what people wanna hear.
that's important to this job.
yeah.
 it's really good.
and sally only has html which prob--if she only lists that, that means she probably is not that sophis--sophisticated and, umm, that really isn't that hard to pick up html.
yeah.
 that's not even grammat--go to lead and train and management. a...
that's does--it's not even grammatical, i don't think. train and manage staff, right?
but a...
but to me, they--i really like hi--i really liked his major. he's public relations...
...marketing minor and communication. that to me was probably one of the strongest majors...
...for the job. i don't know how much involves business administration, how much communications, but i thought that was very strong.
all right.
but, for example, i mean he raised four hundred dollars, which really isn't that much. so you don't really know how good he was at that. just that he attempted it.
???
but i didn't even really notice it until she brought it up. i would if...
i didn't like how her internship only lasted a few months, so it wasn't that much experience.
 i mean, it was good what she did, how she presented product, that was really good experience,
 but it would have been nice if it was a little bit longer.
team leadership training courses on the bottom.
completed that, dorm resident assistant, that requires people skills.
and most likely treasurer, i don't know exactly what's involved in that job, but i'd assume there'd be some.
to me, the only thing that she has is that presented product at trade shows. that was a huge thing,
 but that was the only thing i saw that was impressive.
and public relations and marketing.
yeah. 
and he also lists his gpa, which is a big thing for me.
it means he probably could have even done better if he didn't have--if he wasn't working all the time.
and i--i personally--i personally like wait staff because, umm, that mean--and--and hosts, because this means he's working with people. he's interacting with and people, talking to them.
and he also has photoshop too.
but, of course, it depends how good he is in photoshop, so.
yeah. the two hardest things to pick up, i would say, would probably be photoshop and maybe power point and, umm, he's got 'em
 and mark doesn't really.
word and excel are really easy.
i guess it depends how good you are.
oh, yeah, for sure...
a...
and, of course, umm, since jacob earned fifty percent of his education, means he was working and going to college. which means he probably could have done a lot better in college (???)...)
oh, yeah.
yeah. i.
probably something he did occasionally when the manager was sick or something like that. they would just assign him the job temporarily.
sometell--somehow i got, i don't know if this really applies or not. but i got a feeling that jacob's a guy who likes to party a lot, go out and drink and stuff, well, not so much with mark. some, just--yeah.
well, to me this, umm, this is kind of deciding factor. i know maybe a little superficial, 'cause you really can't tell this from a resume. but when i read these two, a, mark see--mark seems like a friendly face to for--per--a--portray the company with.
umm, jacob seems like a go-getter, which may either be a good thing or a bad thing depend---depending how you wanna port--portray the company.
and he probably should have said like something like my goal is to lead or something. just go to lead and train management staff, i don't--just doesn't sound grammatical.
i also like that mark's, umm, it was--it was simpler to read. umm.
yeah.
i--i think mark's a better writer this--but he might be a little, umm, slightly too introverted. although, it's impossible to tell from this. or he might be the nice guy you wanna portray your company as. it depends, like, what--ho--what you wanna portray your company as. 
if you want the, umm, if you want the go-getter, we're gonna (???), make as much money as possible, whatever, jacob would be the guy. 
and mark would be the guy if you just wanna--wanna portray your company as someone very nice.
just intuitively he was the one that i marked as number one resume.
i vote for mark.
and he's got the artistic skills too.
that's--that's--that to me is a lot harder to pick up than something like html. but i'm also a computer science major, so. i could be--i could be biased.
from what i hear, if this was a real meeting, it probably woulda been over in like ten minutes.
so, if one word they don't like they just throw it away.
yeah. she was my number two, between her and mark. okay.
do you have extra pens?
yeah. no.
yeah.
yeah.
oh.
i agree with like what she said about having theater experience.
 i think that adds charisma and creativity and i feel like the only other thing she really possessed that was an asset was computer skills
. but other than that, i don't think that she had much though to make her qualified.
i.
bye, rosie.
uh huh.
kind of knows something, but just some like very like basic like entry level.
uh huh.
i think it gives 'em interpersonal skills too.
for dealing with that many people.
uh huh.
but he also has scholarships listed an--more than one, as well as the dean's list two semesters. so i feel like that must correlate with something.
???
well, i like something else that he had too, which was under the highlights of qualifications. and where it talks about maintaining a view of the big picture. i think that's something that is very important to just maintain control of a job that has a lot of tasks that are involved in it. so i like that a lot.
yeah.
uh huh.
uh huh.
i think that's a good point.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
uh huh.
i think he did a lot ta, umm, supplement his formal education outside of just his classes and i think that that!
  was a really good thing. that--i just from the advertising and the brochure, the raising money, organizing events, i just feel like he had--he sought out a lot in the fraternity too to, umm, to supplement everything that he was doing. it seems like he has a genuine interest in what he's doing.
but overall 3.6...
well, we don't...
...you can't compare it to the other ones.
umm.
right.
i thought she was okay.
but not all internships are that long.
uh huh.
definitely.
yeah. i was just gonna say that.
uh huh.
yeah.
umm, i would say he seems to be really motivated, umm, just from the amount of stuff that he's done and, umm, earning 50 percent of educational expenses. it just seems like he, i don't know, is motivated...
yeah.
right.
 it seems like he's handling a lot.
uh huh.
well, i think it depends on what the talent show is. like if it was a talent show in like a dorm, i think that's one thing. and if it was like a talent show that was in the pack, and he organized like a big, like, you know, like gala surrounding it or something. i could go either way i feel like too.
plus, there's...
uh huh.
well, umm, just a side point. well, we've kind of put them on an even basis in terms of g--gpa being that jacob is kind of like, you know, okay and mark doesn't list anything besides a couple of awards. 
could we kind of put that on like a...
sort of tends to level out.
but it's always ...
...the summer, yeah.
yeah, but...
uh huh.
yes.
i'd agree.
i think that's fine supplemented by his professional experience.
kind of less formal level...
uh huh.
right.
uh huh.
???
uh huh.
i think that jacob is kind of a gamble in the sense that i feel like he has the potential to grow and flourish in the job, but i don't think that he has enough professional experience to really make that a sure thing.
whereas, i feel like with mark he has professional experience and i feel like he would kind of, umm, perform what was needed. but i have less confidence that he might flourish. does that make sense?
umm.
umm.
(caroline), jess is fine.
...it's completely different.
well, i think to go along with that, i think that could be considered a good thing too. because i think this job definitely calls for someone who is extroverted. they have to organize and manage events. they have to do all these things that, umm--well i guess i'm sort of...
umm.
so.
well... i'm sorry,
go ahead.
well, i pretty much, i said this before, i just feel like jacob has the potential to totally grow into this position. i--and he also has the potential to end up not being great at all, because he has nothing professional to really back it.
but i think that mark, umm, has the ability right now to handle it.
uh huh.
uh huh.
i know that...
sor-- i'm sorry i keep interrupting people.
i know that you had said before that like anyone could say anything they wanted to in the highlights and qualifications, but i think that the fact that he knew that over jacob makes him more of a professional to even add that.
well, personally, i think both resumes are hideous looking. but i think jacob's is worse. jacob's to me looks like an email.
uh huh.
yeah.
umm.
just even that.
well, i think that what that serves as is, a, an interesting like talking and conversational point. and, but i think that it also goes along with sort of his brand as this extroverted, umm...
exactly.
so i think that were it not to be there, it wouldn't, i don't know.
well, i think you're kind of influencing me, umm, also with, umm, what you had said long ago about the typo. just that he may put a very, umm, unprofessional face on the company, just through small things like that.
and honestly, something as simple as layout is a skill that they need to have for this job.
whether it's designing an ad, a web site or something else.
umm.
uh huh.
i think that's where our umm...
sorry. i think that's why our portfolio, like you were saying, would ocme in handy too, just it's evidence to their claims.
i completely agree.
yeah.
me too.
yeah.
i think a bachelor's degree qualifies you to really learn something as basic as a computer skill. so, i don't think that's that big of a issue.
yeah, in a way, yeah.
thank you for asking that.
for some reason they (???) pen.
great. thanks.
humm.
or, yeah. those are all pluses for sure, like the, umm, the html. umm, although, it's not a required skill, it's clearly mentioned in--as--as part of like the job description that...
...you're gonna be, umm, designing some web pages. umm, her--her like major does, a, fit,
 but on the other hand, it's like a broad--it's pretty inclusive in terms of these, a...
so as long as it's not too, a, too di--you know, different. umm...
yeah,
 like the third bullet on employment isn't real specific, umm, in addition to like stress management media--meditation, umm, that could be helpful in any job setting probably. but it--it doesn't really describe how she's like certified in this area. how is this gonna contribute, i guess.
umm.
right.
yeah.
 there's also no dates for the employment. so it could have been a very short period or the entire length of her...
...her undergraduate career there,
 so. umm, strong gpa is--is a (attractive though).
right.
 i mean, this one individual, like he did win a couple scholarships, but it doesn't say what his gpa is, so we really want to (get/guess) mark (is that the ??).
the governor's state scholarship
umm, we would have to kind of look those up to see what they--like the art competition, this does look for some creativity in a job, but like a studio art. that could be really...
yeah.
yeah,
 and he has au--a--a pretty good amount of--it's eight months of work experience and, umm, although he was an intern...
he wasn't like a student employee. so i don't know, it's kind of like almost professional...
...experience, i like that.
yeah.
yeah.
 it doesn't list like html skills, but, umm, that's also not explicitly mentioned in the job description. and if we believe that he is truly a motivated self-starter with the hope could grasp issues that--that shouldn't really exclude him, umm...
but on the other hand, sally, i guess she has definitely some--maintain office web site.
so that could be really for sure...
...asking (???)...
...and used that...
yeah, but...
yeah, on the other hand...
this is--this is business administration. it's not, a, chemistry. i mean, i think the psychology degree's--say, for example, he wa--he was a 4.0 and he did, you know, all these social science things like--like we're doing here now. so, umm, because like this is such a inclusive list here, i feel like it meshes pretty well.
yeah, but i...
it--it implies that, but we would be--we would be guessing there. we would be speculating for sure. just like where she doesn't--her web site, a, it's a pretty, i feel like a reasonable conclusion that to think that, since she doesn't--wasn't real specific. we're--we're talking about her web skills, if they're pretty minimal. a...
on the other hand, they could be really sophisticated i guess too. umm, but likely she--i mean, i--i going back to your point about, umm, the gpa, but i don't really know how, a, like traditional that is to list your gpa. probably the closer you are, the more recent you are from graduating college, the more your gpa is on your resume, but.
yeah.
 i mean, based on the information we have, it makes it difficult 'cause ideally we could just, a, ask 'em.
yeah. 'cause we are talking, umm, unless he'd like to quantify is good, because we get in a sense that sixty residents, that's quite a bit. and they have more, a, maybe like, that's more challenging maybe in a different way than--than children five to ten.
a little different needs.
(???).
and train
yeah.
 that's too bad
 because i think he's actually a really strong candiate...
...otherwise. umm, i mean, if it's...
it depends on how--how much this job will involve like, umm, working with, a, people for sure. and some of it is like behind the scenes though action. not all of it is, a, like a lot of it is a the press releases, the writing, the, a, internet and that type of...
??? aggressive...
right.
yeah.
 plus, his--the skills too here it's listed each of these points. you know, so, umm, otherwi--like if it weren't for--weren't for the a typo.
i think he'd be a really strong candidate for this particular job.
yeah.
 you could also point out too that it depends who he raised the money from. if he was raising it from his fellow, a, peers, it's probably a lot of money. 'cause, umm.
um--many students aren't really interested in contributing a whole lot. whereas, some people in the older demographic are...
you know, that would be like a real pale in comparison, but this is, a, could be--maybe he's really talented at it, you know, umm.
plus, this isn't really a job i feel like that gpa is like really crucial unless it's like below three. umm, it's like a type of job where like...
...being really high in like a social...
...(???) like working with people...
that is like paramount. umm, gpa is...
...is adequate.
right. for sure you need a, a, i think a bachelor's degree just 'cause it's so...
...incredibly common, but, umm, umm, and accesible to most people in your--'cause in your--'cause assuming, fortunately, but. see the problem with a typo is that's such a, umm, our criticism is kinda of very, umm, it's not very substantive critism. it's like, you know, we're gonna--. umm, we assume, maybe, if you were to hire him that he was gonna be more careful on---on the press releases, but i--a.
it is for sure.
and it's very finance and accounting related too.
a, it's not really marketing, ummm.
yeah.
 that's what--that's why the--this was put in there i think to make it (???) yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
 we're not, umm, i don't know, maybe we could say that like jacob learns quickly and he has--he has the html, which, umm, maybe you could say like is--is, a, easy to--to pick up,
 but for someone who has like very little interest in--in learning it, or who, a, struggles with that. i think it would be like pretty insurmountable obstacle, but possibly. umm, 'cause this is just like treasurer. this is just a very finance and accounting, umm, i mean, she might be like smarter than jacob, but she's not a !
 very good--as a better match. she's not a good--good of match for the job. i don't think.
it is good.
yeah. i mean, the problem with that too is--is we see--or we focus on--only on jacob right now, 'cause we see like comparable, a...
skills with mark.
yeah,
 that was big.
yeah. we know for sure he has...
...like power point skills.
i think i disagree with that,
 because i think photoshop is...
...is quite, a, like simple in comparison to, a, html, which is really dynamic and allows for incredible range of abilities.
umm.
'cause you can have like really good web pages...
all the way down to, a...
yeah, but like photoshop for me is not like the tipping point. i mean, umm, i would expect that mark with the intellect he has here, could easily conquer photoshop with html for certain that's yeah. it's just we don't know, but for photoshop we can be certain he--he knows photoshop.
a (???)...
yeah. he (???)...
right. yeah.
 mark has--has...
...superior writing experience.
i think definitely. yeah. i mean, it would be--'cause that's eight months, that internship, umm, it'd be nice if--if he like was, you know, quantified that was more specific with these speeches. umm, how many of them did he proofread and edit versus how many did he like author himself. umm...
you know, but, umm, for sure i think he's--he has better writing skills, but see part of this job too is like presentation skills and like, you know, what the--whatta--i guess i don't know with the type--typo or not, but. yeah.
yeah. that seems fair.
yeah. at this point, i think actually i--i could be convinced, but i'm sort of leaning towards mark...
...because...
the job description does for sure emphasize like these, a, people skills that we keep talking about. but a lot of it is, a, the writing and, a...
???
yeah.
yeah. on that particular point, he has an edge i think over jacob.
yeah, okay.
right. yeah.
 like service liaison between residents and student affairs administration.
so he was advocating for...
...residents probably. and, but also listening to what they say, you know. yeah.
yeah. i mean, i don't think he's trying to be like deceptive. umm, i don't think he was an official manager, i think is basically what that says, like.
it very clearly says like, it very clearly states that he performed duties ranging from that. so, likely when the night manager had the night off or was sick he would, a, kind of substitute and learn some of those duties. but, umm, he didn't have the official title.
umm, but i mean, he's not a night manager, so if he were to put it under work experience that would be, a, over--that would be embellishing and like, this, a, characterizing is--is a work experience. so, i--i mean, i think it's appropriate there.
yeah. like i don't see that as a very a--as a--i don't see it as significant, basically.
yeah.
yeah, but we can't...
...really umm, we have to hire the people that apply.
i would say, a...
mark, because of what (???) just said.
actually, she made a good point, that seems like makes sense too is that, umm, yeah, for sure, like, there's less risk involved with, a, mark. like there's really evidence that, a, he had the, a, professional experience, umm, for, eight months.
and, umm, i think, a, yeah. i think, umm, with jacob, umm, yeah. you cou--it could go, a, either way if you hire him even.
yeah, for sure.
right.
yeah.
 see that's--that's--that's what makes it such a...
...difficult task, because you want someone who's really agressive socially, i think for this job. on the other hand, umm, i keep looking at the job description and thinking that it's not quite as like, umm, emphasizing, umm, like the social aspects as, a, as would be a perfect ma--it's--it's like still a better match for mark because of the presentation. a, the written skills, umm.
yeah.
yeah. just say manage special events such as sponserships, parties, introducing new products, or relationships, umm, to gain public attention. so you do want someone who will like promote, umm.
yeah. yeah. so you really want someone really, a, extroverted, but still likeable.
not like conceited, of course, or not like, umm, (???).
right. 'cause this is just designed to see how we interact together, just because like to--to get inside into our decision making. just 'cause like this wouldn't probably never, a, 'cause this is when you--we wanna call the references and ask.
about what, how's...
...mark. umm, and meet the--i mean, i guess this goes without saying, but, umm, yeah, to be clear--i don't know, i feel like it is still important to state that you would never, a, hire someone like this when--for the cost of nothing, you could easily just meet them and call their employers. umm, but, so it makes it really...
...difficult.
yeah.
i mean, these aren't sentences either, but...
???/sorry.
???
yeah. 'cause he picked out these things from this job description and that's what he chose to highlight or tailor for this particular, a, resume that he submitted.
yeah.
yeah. clearly with this like he--he cared, 'cause he read the job description and.
yeah.
umm, which shows like a high le--shows some interest compared to a...
...media relations executive is not--that takes a lifetime probably to...
...achieve. (???).
right. 'cause it says some of the responsibilities are write interesting and effective press releases and prepare information for ads and/or media kits.
yeah.
(???)
yeah. it's--it's a little bit busy i think for sure.
like with the education, i mean.
but i think mark's was also a lot simpler. i mean, it--it didn't show that he, umm, really knew how to use all the word processing software very much, but...
...but jacob showed that he, umm, had a better comprehension of word processing software, even though it wasn't perfect.
(???)
yeah. we've local as opposed to distant area natives. so, i don't even know why he...
...put local.
no, it's probably appropriate, i guess, 'cause.
they were from the (???).
yeah.
 this is, umm, like heavy on image and like more, a, this attempts to be like really emphasize like flash more than this is, a, very substantive and, umm, the job description says, you know, excellent verbal and written skills. a, strong creative--strong writing skills basically.
he's very understated.
he's--he's, a, not as concerned about, a, appearance, which, umm, which could be sort of, a, difficult for this job, but...
...umm,
i think that's fine in it...
yeah.
right. yeah, that's true.
yeah. i mean, jacob has like a lot of hustle for sure. it's just very aggressive. he earned 50 percent of educational expenses. umm, he's, a, seems real persistent, a, with people, you know, i think. umm, so he'd be like charming and, a, persuasive, but this isn't sales as much as it is, a, writing press releases, presentations, so. umm.
yeah.
(???) professional--go ahead...
yeah, but i mean, how many natives from albany, new york? i'm not that--that--umm, let's not focus on it.
what?
yeah. i don't ev--even think mark is middle of the--of the road in terms of the resumes we've got. i think he's the--basically the best compared to the resumes we've (???).
yeah. i mean, plus, for the required skills, they're all things he basically already knows for required skills.
thanks.
so is this more enjoyable than doing your online thing?
thanks.
yeah.
thanks.
yeah
i assume we--are we ruling that one out then?
i
yeah, that's--that's
right.
yeah.
 jacob was my personal favorite. out of like all the other resumes, they seemed kind of bland to me, but i really like how he has all this a, this--all these people skills listed. i mean, what i got from just glancing over the job description was they want someone to really rep their company. they want them to be face...
...and this is like a young kid, he was in a fraternity, did all this, a, he--all this, a, like, a--a events and, umm, shows that he p--and so he was pretty much, a, the one i liked the best. and he had those computer skills.
??? at some point
yeah.
 i mean, this is word, word and excel for mark.
oh, yeah.
humpf.
yeah.
yeah.
other than that, i don't see too many people--other people skills.
ra.
i think it's one thing to deal with your peers, like kids your age.
 but then when you--with jacob, where he's dealing with other people, not just students. i think it's different in my eyes.
yeah.
 i was kinda of hoping to see more like you could say you're an ra, but you can just sit in your room and like, a, deal with like academ--or, a, a, like judicial problems with your--with your, a, residents. but she didn't really, a, say that too much about like what programs they hosted.
or like what things they did in their common rooms or something. so ra, what--to what depth?
yeah. take her out.?
yeah.
yeah.
absolutely. it's tough, so.
what, that he didn't like, project himself more into taking a better job? or a think about that.
management.
okay.
like with the html skills, isn't say what he used them for as like, but still his computer skills are a little, umm, deeper
 maybe more than--than mark.
yeah.
humpf.
to me it boils down to, a, jacob--they both have a good amount of experience. jacob seems to have like a more social experience. while mark's...
...a experience is more formal. he has that, a, a good internship and, a, the ra. i like how he elaborated on that. programs, advice, 60 residents, that's impressive. so...
i'm looking at the, a, the bullets under responsibilities, include, but are not limited to. a, the, a, four little stars there, i think, a, mark takes it on the first three
 and jacob may have an advantage on the last one.
 although, mark doesn't really tout his, a, social abilities or, kind of a downfall just looking at paper instead of interviewing 'em. but, a, i think, a, mark kinda takes it there.
yeah.
there you go.
oh, yeah, absolutely.
 i think they have--both have their pros and cons, but when it comes down to one.
 all right. do you wanna go around the table and just pick who you like the best?
okay.
yeah.|
maybe it was 'cause it was night he didn't really do that much. so he didn't really consider it.
and maybe that speaks on his char..
...on his part then for not putting it.
right.
parties.
humpf.
yeah.
so equal parts like hypeman and part like manager too.
yeah.
humpf.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah. this is like...
yeah. well, laid out.
uh huh.
absolutely.
yeah.
a, mark's a safer bet from just looking at these two.
yeah.
it's not like crazy parties.
the terminology.
yeah.
yeah. i like mark. he has his core skills there, the professionalism.
and if you strip away like the social stuff, 'cause you can't really judge that. i mean, you can really say anything. or i mean on--in their resumes, when you take away, a, what they say about their social skills, when you--you have that, the core skills that they built in their undergrad. i like what i see with mark.
yeah. we don't even know the level of the computer skills that, a, jacob has.
that's a good point, yeah.
and they only say word, power point, excel. so if you really--if you take out html, i mean, the web site's probably gonna be there and they probably already have the infrastructure of the web site. so you're just gonna be updating with text. you can see mark has the better writing skills. they both know microsoft word. so, then it wo!
 rks better.
yeah, the award.
exactly. it was shoo, shoo.
really?
humm.
how long did that take?
oh.
thanks.
yeah.
these don't work.
thank you.
okay. well, since it's just about 4:30, why don't we get started. we can go through these one by one or we can talk about the guys--the ones you guys have already read--in--from--from what we did online before. it's a little easier i think to go through them one by one, rule them out that way. but, i mean, it's up to you. anybody who has an input. feel free to jump in.
yeah.
well, she doesn't meet the requirement for education, 'cause they ask for a bachelor's degree.
 so i agree with you.
yeah.
as far as resumes go, i like her qualification summary.
 it's out there. i don't know, just--thought that was kinda funny.
yep.
 all in favor say i.
so no rosie. all right.
 how 'bout sally next? she's got a ba in administration, which is good. and a pretty high gpa, which is also important. and she mentions all three of the p.c. skills that are mentioned on the job description. so also a plus.
yeah.
uh huh.
yeah
she also really doesn't have any work experience that's like directly related.
yeah.
yeah.
and then she was a writer for her yearbook, but i don't know if that really qualifies her to write...
a, press releases.
yeah.
yeah.
uh huh.
(???/kids.)
yeah.
that's definite plus.
he still learned...
yeah.
still learn a lot doing internships though.
and he was a res hall--or resident assistant, so he knows how to manage things.
yeah.
definitely.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
but...
he could be io psych, which is industrial organizational.
so it doesn't say what...
yeah.
yeah,
 if he's gotten the dean's list for two semesters that means he had to have at least a 3.5...
...for those two semesters.
yeah.
but...
...that's a good skill.
and he, like--i--going back to the points of like the responsibilities, he's gotta, umm, manage the special events and does that with res hall stuff.
 where, i mean, sally was a camp counselor, so it's like two different sides of the same coin.
but the other thing is, is that he's gonna be working --er, well, whoever we choose, is gonna be working with peers and, i mean, sally's working with children, whereas, mark's working with college age people.
so, i mean, he has to have some sort of--not just like the authority age, but like also like charisma to go along with the...
yeah. 
so should we rule out sally? yes?
yes.
all right. who's next? jacob?
yeah.
yeah. he was ???...
computer skills they asked for. whereas like, sorry, mark doesn't list, a, power point. i mean, which isn't really hard, but, i mean i think if they're asking for it, you should at least tell 'em that you know how to do it.
and i don't know if i necessarily like his work experience compared to mark, because mark was managing people. whereas, jacob's a waiter slash host.
it's not an easy job, but.
yeah.
he had a typo?
oooh, where?
oh, yeah, that's....
that would be a negative.
yeah.
i mean, he does list his gpa.
he's writing and he's got typo on his resume. i mean, how--what's.
and come back once we've gone through everything.
he also does the organizing for the special events. he did the talent show and the sales strategy for--or sales presentation strategy for his fraternity car show. so, i--i think those are both pluses.
yeah.
he also did the informal brochure, which is like part of the press release aspect of it.
yeah.
well, that's his end major gpa, but...
...his overall's a little higher.
i do think education's...
...important though, because he's not gonna learn like, umpf, he's not gonna learn to just fix his typos if he's like got.
yeah.
yeah, but i mean, your resume's really important too. that's how you get your job.
i didn't either,
 but now that i see it...
...it's glaring at me.
yeah.
so why don't we keep both mark and jacob as...
...like potential candidates. talk about pamela.
yeah.
yeah.
 it's looks like it's just a summer internship.
yeah.
but she does present at the trade shows.
any leadership (???).
yeah.
i don't know. she's also, i mean, the dorm room assistant, like i think that's a good thing,
 'cause we said that was good for mark too.
so, i mean, that shows people skills and management skills, because you have to be able to like kind of organize things and keep people in line. so that's one side of it.
okay. everyone in favor of pamela say no.
 i--i'm against her, so.
??? against her. all right. i said that all backwards, but. so it's jacob versus mark. da da da.
 all right. let's go through the pluses of jacob and the minuses. he's got the typo. that's minus.
 but he has a ba in communications.
yeah.
so it's a plus?
but his work experience is only in the summers.
yeah.
i mean, we can go both, back and forth.
yeah.
yeah. i don't know, i don't think the wait staff is really on his side, though.
well, he doesn't have the management experience that mark has. he doesn't have--and in terms of management, i mean like managing...
...people.
i mean, he's got the management training. but that's really i mean, he's got manangement training by organizing a talent show. i don't know if that's really--that's a plus for the special events, but not--he doesn't..
he says it's for the semester at sea.
so.
yeah.
yeah, i actually really disagree with that.
there's online guides for like all of this stuff. so there's easy access to web ???)...
if you don't have it already. and that's like the one thing that makes me like wonder if ...
but mark's...
...it seems like mark has more writing experience.
yeah.
yeah.
well, do we wanna go over the pluses of mark also, like again? i don't know. i don't know what--there's a b--or weigh them against each other. you guys tell me.
well...
sorry. go ahead.
mark was working during the year
 and jacob was only working during the summers.
yeah, but an ra's not easy.
yeah, but it doesn't mean that you don't have ta'--i mean, if--if--if all jacob is doing is working over the summers and participating in his frat stuff. i think that's like the same sort of thing.
but i think that being an ra you have to manage more things. you have to...
... you have to be accountable for your residents and you have to like hold certain events.
well, why don't we go...
...back through the job description, 'cause that'll probably give us our answer.
so, like they want motivated team player. i mean, they're both motivated and they both have people skills. and they want a bachelor's degree in one of the related fields. and mark doesn't have a bachelor's degree in business, or journalism, or commu!
 nication, but it's in psych. which is a good thing or a bad thing depending on where he focused in.
i think so too.
i mean, if they're gonna develop and implement strategies, we see that with mark's more than we see it with jacob's, because mark has to like write, proof, and edit these speeches and press releases, so.
yeah, but we...
...i guess.
yeah.
i mean, the thing about the res hall that goes with this also is that, like, you have to design content for internal and external like media. whether it be web sites or like the programs that he's putting out. like the information!
  that he's providing. and he (???) with information for his residents. so i feel like that's both an internal and external thing. as--like in--in his job, too.
it says they will support the (???) goals of the organization by designing content for internal and external web sites and social media.
so i think that mark's experience lends itself more to internal and external interactions than jacob's does.
yeah.
both sides.
plus, i mean, if he's working, or if he worked with that management intern, then he was working with other people in his office to put forth these press releases and speeches.
i mean, if this was a real short list, we could interview both of them, but...
???
i don--i think they both would be good for the job.
we still got another hour, so we--we can keep talking about this.
sorry, what were you gonna say?
umm.
even with that, that's...
no, i got that feeling too. he's--
i mean, if he's in a frat, i mean.
well, and not to characterize...
...all frat boys...
...(???) a certain way.
a, my ex-roommates were in professional frat...
no, no. i know, but they were in a professional frat and they did the same sort of thing, sort of things as a...
...social frat did.
well, i'm not saying anything bad about it.
but.
but mark's got the social aspect too 'cause...
yeah.
but he says that he developed programs for like he--he--the programs are--are not just like, umm, they can be social events...
...too.
so that's the other thing. it's like.
the product?
i don't know i still feel like mark has the better experience and...
no, go ahead.
umm, yeah.
well, let's just pretend...
...they're on a, on a unreachable island somewhere...
we can't call them. i--a--i--a really--i think jacob would be an o--a better candidate if mark wasn't sitting right next to 'em. i don't know.
yeah, but his summary of qualifications is nice, too. umm, you know, creative, resourceful, and flexible, able to adapt to changing priorities and maintain a positive attitude and strong work ethics. so you can see how that fits into the will it be required in this setting here at the growing e-commerce company. motivated team player, someone who can roll with punches at that,
 umm, whereas jacob doesn't have the--he doesn't even have like a--a few sentences, like a couple...
yeah.
 and it's not even in grammatical, you know, his objective. so, i think this is more like a generic thing and this was specially written for the, umm, job.
uh huh. yeah.
i don't know. i don't think.
and he tailored his application...
...to the job.
yeah.
yeah. well, i mean, as a bullet point it's not terrible, but i think he should have used maybe just--just at least reread it or read it aloud to himself one--once more before submitting it. goal to lead and train and management staff.
yeah.
yeah. well, on that side of it, i mean, he's got--we're gonna be super nitpicky, under his skills like the third hi--like line he's got everything tabbed over in the lines before, the second part of it is not in line. you know, it just looks a little messy to me. and if you're gonna be creating a press releases, then i think you might want it to look a little neater.
yeah.
i don't know i think...
i think the language is offensive.
partier.
guy.
yeah.
yeah. umm, i don't know, i think the fact that mark has all these scholarships. i mean, he doesn't have his gpa listed, which is definitely.
yeah.
but he does have...
...creativity aspect in the hallmark award competition.
the art competition.
yeah. it's not as busy.
yeah.
i don't know. i feel like jacob's got this pamphlet for the brochure for the apartment leasing ocmpany, but then mark's got all the, umm, speeches, press releases from his inte!
 rnship. plus, the stuff that he did with the res hall. i think that's--i think he's probably got more stuff to show us. that he's prepared for the job itself.
that's the other thing that i--like it's kind of good that you can't meet these people for a fake job. because jacob might come in here and be like all charming and like, no, i'll--i'll be super good at this job. and mark might be a little shier, but he might be the better candidate, because of his work experience and hi!
 s training.
yeah.
yeah.
plus, the parties, i mean, they're not supposed to be like crazy keggers.
i think we're all in agreed...
no. no. go ahead. i'd like to hear.
oh, yeah.
humm, i don't know, i think the rest of them had parts of it. and it seems like mark and jacob have it all, but in differing degrees.
like the (???) candidate.
yeah.
i think mark's the guy.
i think we're all agreed.
he does.
and you can learn the other computer skills that he doesn't necessarily have.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
and i think, all right, mark's it. yea.
 should we discuss anything else?
okay.
yeah. i don't know, i kind of liked sally's, just 'cause she's the massage therapist. so she's gotta have the people skills for massage therapist.
coulda been much worse. these--these jobs, i mean, i mean, some of the resumes that we had for the other jobs that we were deciding on online, that was during the last session, they're like really hard to choose because the canidates were like so closely matched.
that it was just like--like one person didn't like it because of, like something really ridiculous and the other person didn't like him because he was a boy or something like that. really random things to argue over. glad we all agreed.
makes life a lot easier.
only twenty after five.
this definitely giving me things to think about for my own resume.
i think we can take these off.
umm, yes. (???) the internet. so it's not so--i mean, i'd--i'd be typing up stuff (???).
yeah. i'd do it.
a, and meg has been (???) to be our leaders today. so she will be kind of facilitating, making sure that we are on track. making sure that the time has been kept.
yeah.
 looks like she like...
and he also has experience with writing press releases
that is big.
just like with developing like the programs for his residents or whatever, you could say it would help with managing the special events for (???).
but that's still like generally saying that she posted updated content...
...it could just be that she like just plugs in like whatever people give her.
so you don't really know what that means.
he could write that...
it looks like he doesn't...
...have maybe a lot of like professional experience, but what he did do, he like was very involved with.
like he can pull, you know, things from cl--class and like school, umm, organizations.
but he's..
he did also just graduate, so you could say that he didn't have time to have a job maybe while he was at school, but he was very involved in school while he was there.
so it kind a.
umm.
well, but that he does have experience with events, event planning or whatever. which is more than any of the other people do, so.
but she doesn't really seem to have the creative side at all.
and even that--that could you could say that that's just like sales, which isn't really something that--i don't know.
and it's stressful.
but he has...
he has both of them, though.
just mark that doesn't (???) it.
but he also has the...
... the art award. so he must be somewhat creative, but.
since he only...
but it's over (???) the summer...
well, mark was only an ra during the year, i mean.
yeah, but it like works around your school schedule, 'cause it's through the school.
well,
he might have to with fr--fraternity also.
but then jacob also has the, he has the brochure for an apartment leasing company and for, a, presentation for the school.
so he does have some.
yeah.
wait, what did you say?
yeah. 'cause jacob kind of went out of his way, ta' you know, it wasn't his job--like he didn't need to do these extra activities while he was at school.
well, (???) not for a...
...management position.
well, it's--
it's a professional (???).
...professional frat...
...it's not a social frat.
yeah. i'm just saying, though, like it's not like a frat boy...
yeah, i--i mean, social...
i'm in that frat, so, not yet.
no. no. i'm saying there--there definitely is drinking involved, but just not--it's not like a social frat. like that's, yeah.
yeah, it says right here...
...special events and parties.
and the same--and also when you're making a resume you don't try and make it look like you're social, you know.
uh huh.
that's true.
and he had the room to like space it out more...
...and make it look better.
but just that he had like a header type thing.
yeah. jacob is saying that he has like created these brochures and this presentation, but like he can't put together a resume. so.
yeah, and it's just, when they talk about content for the web sites. like they say designing content, not like actually designing the web site. it's just the content, so.
this--this, a, (???).
