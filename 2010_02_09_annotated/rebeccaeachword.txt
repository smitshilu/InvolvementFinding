a,
and
meg
has
been
(???)
to
be
our
leaders
today.
so
she
will
be
kind
of
facilitating,
making
sure
that
we
are
on
track.
making
sure
that
the
time
has
been
kept.
yeah.
looks
like
she
like...
and
he
also
has
experience
with
writing
press
releases
that
is
big.
just
like
with
developing
like
the
programs
for
his
residents
or
whatever,
you
could
say
it
would
help
with
managing
the
special
events
for
(???).
but
that's
still
like
generally
saying
that
she
posted
updated
content...
...it
could
just
be
that
she
like
just
plugs
in
like
whatever
people
give
her.
so
you
don't
really
know
what
that
means.
he
could
write
that...
it
looks
like
he
doesn't...
...have
maybe
a
lot
of
like
professional
experience,
but
what
he
did
do,
he
like
was
very
involved
with.
like
he
can
pull,
you
know,
things
from
cl--class
and
like
school,
umm,
organizations.
but
he's..
he
did
also
just
graduate,
so
you
could
say
that
he
didn't
have
time
to
have
a
job
maybe
while
he
was
at
school,
but
he
was
very
involved
in
school
while
he
was
there.
so
it
kind
a.
umm.
well,
but
that
he
does
have
experience
with
events,
event
planning
or
whatever.
which
is
more
than
any
of
the
other
people
do,
so.
but
she
doesn't
really
seem
to
have
the
creative
side
at
all.
and
even
that--that
could
you
could
say
that
that's
just
like
sales,
which
isn't
really
something
that--i
don't
know.
and
it's
stressful.
but
he
has...
he
has
both
of
them,
though.
just
mark
that
doesn't
(???)
it.
but
he
also
has
the...
...
the
art
award.
so
he
must
be
somewhat
creative,
but.
since
he
only...
but
it's
over
(???)
the
summer...
well,
mark
was
only
an
ra
during
the
year,
i
mean.
yeah,
but
it
like
works
around
your
school
schedule,
'cause
it's
through
the
school.
well,
he
might
have
to
with
fr--fraternity
also.
but
then
jacob
also
has
the,
he
has
the
brochure
for
an
apartment
leasing
company
and
for,
a,
presentation
for
the
school.
so
he
does
have
some.
yeah.
wait,
what
did
you
say?
yeah.
'cause
jacob
kind
of
went
out
of
his
way,
ta'
you
know,
it
wasn't
his
job--like
he
didn't
need
to
do
these
extra
activities
while
he
was
at
school.
well,
(???)
not
for
a...
...management
position.
well,
it's--
it's
a
professional
(???).
...professional
frat...
...it's
not
a
social
frat.
yeah.
i'm
just
saying,
though,
like
it's
not
like
a
frat
boy...
yeah,
i--i
mean,
social...
i'm
in
that
frat,
so,
not
yet.
no.
no.
i'm
saying
there--there
definitely
is
drinking
involved,
but
just
not--it's
not
like
a
social
frat.
like
that's,
yeah.
yeah,
it
says
right
here...
...special
events
and
parties.
and
the
same--and
also
when
you're
making
a
resume
you
don't
try
and
make
it
look
like
you're
social,
you
know.
uh
huh.
that's
true.
and
he
had
the
room
to
like
space
it
out
more...
...and
make
it
look
better.
but
just
that
he
had
like
a
header
type
thing.
yeah.
jacob
is
saying
that
he
has
like
created
these
brochures
and
this
presentation,
but
like
he
can't
put
together
a
resume.
so.
yeah,
and
it's
just,
when
they
talk
about
content
for
the
web
sites.
like
they
say
designing
content,
not
like
actually
designing
the
web
site.
it's
just
the
content,
so.
this--this,
a,
(???).
