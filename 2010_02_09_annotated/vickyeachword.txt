right.
and
she
has
no
related
experience.
umm,
she
probably
has
charisma.
it
looks
like
she
was--she
played
several
leads,
which
would
be
good,
but
she's--doesn't
seem
qualified
for
the
job.
maybe
to
work
underneath
the
job
we're
hiring
for,
but.
not
the
job
itself.
yeah.
considering
that
she
has
no
experience
and
that
the
only
skill
that
she's
mentioning
isn't
like
a
high
level
skill,
it's
not
very
hard
to
keep
a
web
site
updated.
especially
with
the
software
programs
they
have
now.
i
think
at
least
her
compared
to
mark,
i
would
say
that
she's
not
a
strong
candidate.
umm..
...
that
she
has
no
experience
that's
directly
related
to
it
really
hurts
her.
that--i
did...
...notice
that.
umm.
yeah.
i
say
i.
i
think
the
important
thing
here
is
that
we're
looking
for
someone
who's
going
to
be
a
team
leader,
not
just
on
the
team.
and
to
jump
in
only
having
experience
as
a
waiter
works
against
him.
he--i--i
really
agree
with
jeremy
that
he
does
have
the
most
effective
resume,
but
i
think
he's
also
the
only
one
who
had
a
typo
on
it.
and
i'm
nitpicky
about
that.
he
did.
umm...
underneath
the
first
section,
objective,
train
and
management
staff.
it's
little,
but
it's
important
and
if
this
is
his
resume
and
he's
got
a
typo
on
it...
...is
he
gonna
have
typos
on
the
press
releases?
team.
it
was
probably
just...
...a
miss
click,
but
he
didn't
read
over
it
before
submitting
it,
which
isn't
very
professional
of
him.
yes.
he
seems
strong,
but
not
perfect.
so
maybe
we
could
keep
him
as
a
maybe.
uh
huh.
umm.
although,
that
did
effect
his
schoolwork,
because
he
has
one
of
the
lower
gpas.
he
has
a
3.3
versus
3.6,
3.8,
which
isn't...
well
the
end
major's
what
we're
concerned
with
though.
we
don't
really
care
about
what
other
classes
he
took...
it
wouldn't...
...be
a
huge
deal,
but
considering
that
creating
press
releases
is
going
to
be
a
large
part
of
his
duties,
umm,
i
would
argue
that
you're
more
careful
on
your
resume
and
your
cover
letter
than
you
would
be
just
doing
the
99th
of
100
tasks
that
you've
been
doing
for
the
same
company.
i
think
you'd
be
more
careful
when
you
really
have
something
to
lose
if
you
don't
do
well
compared
to
when
you're
comfortable
and
in
your
job
and
in
the
grind.
umm.
and
he
has
probably
the
most
persuasive,
umm,
resume.
he
is
directly,
a,
umm,
addressing
things
that
the
job
description
does.
which
is
just
a
persuasive
writing
technique
and
he's
the
only
one
really
showing
that
and
hitting
every
point.
umm,
with
jacob,
i
just
noticed
a
kind
of
weird
discrepancy,
there,
umm,
i
mean,
not
just
the
typo,
this
is
a
little
bit
less
picky
than
that.
umm,
under
management
training,
organizational
ability.
he
says
that
he
performed
restaurant
duties
ranging
from
busboy
to
night
mananger.
if
he
has
official
management
experience,
why
didn't
he
list
that
in
his
work
experience?
that's
a
strange,
umm,
typo.
it
makes
me
wonder,
was
he
officially
a
mananger
ever
or
did
he
jump
in
one
night
when
the
manager
was
sick...
...and
vomiting
in
the
bathroom.
but...
...if
he
had
management
experience
and
this
is
management,
he
would
be
listing
that
under
work
experience
even
if
it
was
like
two
months.
he
just
wouldn't
put
dates.
he
would
put
mananger.
umm.
that's
something
he
still
could
have
listed
under
actual
work
experience,
though.
umm,
whether
you
see
that
as
being
deceptive,
or
whether
it's
just
not
persuasive
writing,
or
not
organized
writing.
the
way
he
put
that
together
was
a
very
poor
choice
considering
how
small
his
work
experience
is.
umm.
humm.
if
this
was
a
real
situation.
i
think
jacob's
really
promising,
and
mark's
really
promising.
i
would
never
hiether--hire
either
one
of
them
as
a
manager.
when
one
has
one
internship
under
his
belt
and
one
has
been
a
waiter...
...during
the
summer.
umm,
it's
the
specialist
who
lead
the
team,
isn't
it?
that's
what
i
read.
right.
we
have
to
hire...
...one
of
these
people.
in
real
life
i
wouldn't.
so
we
have
to
be
nitpicky,
because
this
is
what
his
job
would
be.
is
to
create...
...convincing
documents.
his
document
is
convincing
and
i
think
in
some
ways
it's
more
convincing
than
mark's.
i
like
the
way
it's
laid
out.
i
like
how
he
specifically
picked
out
the
different
skills
that
are
relevant
to
the
position.
umm,
in
other
ways,
some
of
it's
weird.
some
of
it's
sloppy,
he
has
a
typo.
uh
huh.
one
thing
that
i--keeps
jumping
out
at
me
from
jacob's,
is
under
the
communications
language
tab,
the
last
part
there.
traveled
around
the
world
with
semester
at
cnu's,
conversational
and
communications
skills
to
interact
with
local
area
natives.
one,
it's
redundant,
conversational
and
communication
skills,
because
when
he
was
"communicating
wi!
th
the
natives"...
...only
part
of
it
was
conversation,
the
rest
of
it
was,
a,
sign
language
he
made
up
on
the
spot.
to
interact
with
them.
plus
natives.
like.
i
think
it's--it's
good
because
it
shows
that
he
can
communicate
with
people
from
other
cultures
and
that's
a
very
good
thing
in
advertising.
but
the
way
he
wrote
it,
it
was
so
ineffective
and...
...almost
offensive
in
a
way.
he's--he's
proving
and
disprov--he's
proving
and
disproving
his
point
in
that...
...sentence.
uh
huh.
i
think
that
if
we
were
going
to
call
them
in,
we
would
probably
need
to
have
a
small
portfolio
with
both
of
them
to
see
what...
...sort
of...
...related
documents...
...can
you
provide.
and
look
at
it
that
way.
uh
huh.
i
think
that
in
some
way
jacob
is
the
best
candidate
and
the
worst
candidate
and
mark
is
sort
of
middle
of
the
road.
he
hasn't
thrown
all
the
parties,
which
is
one
thing
that
we
do
want
for
this
job.
he's
supposed
to
manage
special
events
and
parties.
that
is
part
of
it,
but
at
the
same
time,
we
don't
feel
like
he's
just
going
to
totally
drop
the
ball
like
jacob
might.
right.
but
that
social
skill
of
walking
around
the
room
and
making
sure
everybody,
that
you
say
hi
to
everybody,
have
you
heard
about
our
new
product?
i
feel
like
jacob
could
probably
do
that
from,
just
from
his
description
of
talking
to
the
natives.
right.
i--i
wasn't
comparing
him
to
a
list
of
all
the
other
candidates,
i
was
just
looking
at,
as
far
as
our...
...characteristics
for
the
ideal
candidate...
...with
the
job
description.
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
resumes
being
thrown
away
right
now.
