do
you
have
extra
pens?
yeah.
no.
yeah.
yeah.
oh.
i
agree
with
like
what
she
said
about
having
theater
experience.
i
think
that
adds
charisma
and
creativity
and
i
feel
like
the
only
other
thing
she
really
possessed
that
was
an
asset
was
computer
skills
.
but
other
than
that,
i
don't
think
that
she
had
much
though
to
make
her
qualified.
i.
bye,
rosie.
uh
huh.
kind
of
knows
something,
but
just
some
like
very
like
basic
like
entry
level.
uh
huh.
i
think
it
gives
'em
interpersonal
skills
too.
for
dealing
with
that
many
people.
uh
huh.
but
he
also
has
scholarships
listed
an--more
than
one,
as
well
as
the
dean's
list
two
semesters.
so
i
feel
like
that
must
correlate
with
something.
???
well,
i
like
something
else
that
he
had
too,
which
was
under
the
highlights
of
qualifications.
and
where
it
talks
about
maintaining
a
view
of
the
big
picture.
i
think
that's
something
that
is
very
important
to
just
maintain
control
of
a
job
that
has
a
lot
of
tasks
that
are
involved
in
it.
so
i
like
that
a
lot.
yeah.
uh
huh.
uh
huh.
i
think
that's
a
good
point.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
uh
huh.
i
think
he
did
a
lot
ta,
umm,
supplement
his
formal
education
outside
of
just
his
classes
and
i
think
that
that!
was
a
really
good
thing.
that--i
just
from
the
advertising
and
the
brochure,
the
raising
money,
organizing
events,
i
just
feel
like
he
had--he
sought
out
a
lot
in
the
fraternity
too
to,
umm,
to
supplement
everything
that
he
was
doing.
it
seems
like
he
has
a
genuine
interest
in
what
he's
doing.
but
overall
3.6...
well,
we
don't...
...you
can't
compare
it
to
the
other
ones.
umm.
right.
i
thought
she
was
okay.
but
not
all
internships
are
that
long.
uh
huh.
definitely.
yeah.
i
was
just
gonna
say
that.
uh
huh.
yeah.
umm,
i
would
say
he
seems
to
be
really
motivated,
umm,
just
from
the
amount
of
stuff
that
he's
done
and,
umm,
earning
50
percent
of
educational
expenses.
it
just
seems
like
he,
i
don't
know,
is
motivated...
yeah.
right.
it
seems
like
he's
handling
a
lot.
uh
huh.
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
the
talent
show
is.
like
if
it
was
a
talent
show
in
like
a
dorm,
i
think
that's
one
thing.
and
if
it
was
like
a
talent
show
that
was
in
the
pack,
and
he
organized
like
a
big,
like,
you
know,
like
gala
surrounding
it
or
something.
i
could
go
either
way
i
feel
like
too.
plus,
there's...
uh
huh.
well,
umm,
just
a
side
point.
well,
we've
kind
of
put
them
on
an
even
basis
in
terms
of
g--gpa
being
that
jacob
is
kind
of
like,
you
know,
okay
and
mark
doesn't
list
anything
besides
a
couple
of
awards.
could
we
kind
of
put
that
on
like
a...
sort
of
tends
to
level
out.
but
it's
always
...
...the
summer,
yeah.
yeah,
but...
uh
huh.
yes.
i'd
agree.
i
think
that's
fine
supplemented
by
his
professional
experience.
kind
of
less
formal
level...
uh
huh.
right.
uh
huh.
???
uh
huh.
i
think
that
jacob
is
kind
of
a
gamble
in
the
sense
that
i
feel
like
he
has
the
potential
to
grow
and
flourish
in
the
job,
but
i
don't
think
that
he
has
enough
professional
experience
to
really
make
that
a
sure
thing.
whereas,
i
feel
like
with
mark
he
has
professional
experience
and
i
feel
like
he
would
kind
of,
umm,
perform
what
was
needed.
but
i
have
less
confidence
that
he
might
flourish.
does
that
make
sense?
umm.
umm.
(caroline),
jess
is
fine.
...it's
completely
different.
well,
i
think
to
go
along
with
that,
i
think
that
could
be
considered
a
good
thing
too.
because
i
think
this
job
definitely
calls
for
someone
who
is
extroverted.
they
have
to
organize
and
manage
events.
they
have
to
do
all
these
things
that,
umm--well
i
guess
i'm
sort
of...
umm.
so.
well...
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
well,
i
pretty
much,
i
said
this
before,
i
just
feel
like
jacob
has
the
potential
to
totally
grow
into
this
position.
i--and
he
also
has
the
potential
to
end
up
not
being
great
at
all,
because
he
has
nothing
professional
to
really
back
it.
but
i
think
that
mark,
umm,
has
the
ability
right
now
to
handle
it.
uh
huh.
uh
huh.
i
know
that...
sor--
i'm
sorry
i
keep
interrupting
people.
i
know
that
you
had
said
before
that
like
anyone
could
say
anything
they
wanted
to
in
the
highlights
and
qualifications,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
he
knew
that
over
jacob
makes
him
more
of
a
professional
to
even
add
that.
well,
personally,
i
think
both
resumes
are
hideous
looking.
but
i
think
jacob's
is
worse.
jacob's
to
me
looks
like
an
email.
uh
huh.
yeah.
umm.
just
even
that.
well,
i
think
that
what
that
serves
as
is,
a,
an
interesting
like
talking
and
conversational
point.
and,
but
i
think
that
it
also
goes
along
with
sort
of
his
brand
as
this
extroverted,
umm...
exactly.
so
i
think
that
were
it
not
to
be
there,
it
wouldn't,
i
don't
know.
well,
i
think
you're
kind
of
influencing
me,
umm,
also
with,
umm,
what
you
had
said
long
ago
about
the
typo.
just
that
he
may
put
a
very,
umm,
unprofessional
face
on
the
company,
just
through
small
things
like
that.
and
honestly,
something
as
simple
as
layout
is
a
skill
that
they
need
to
have
for
this
job.
whether
it's
designing
an
ad,
a
web
site
or
something
else.
umm.
uh
huh.
i
think
that's
where
our
umm...
sorry.
i
think
that's
why
our
portfolio,
like
you
were
saying,
would
ocme
in
handy
too,
just
it's
evidence
to
their
claims.
i
completely
agree.
yeah.
me
too.
yeah.
i
think
a
bachelor's
degree
qualifies
you
to
really
learn
something
as
basic
as
a
computer
skill.
so,
i
don't
think
that's
that
big
of
a
issue.
yeah,
in
a
way,
yeah.
