thank
you
for
asking
that.
for
some
reason
they
(???)
pen.
great.
thanks.
humm.
or,
yeah.
those
are
all
pluses
for
sure,
like
the,
umm,
the
html.
umm,
although,
it's
not
a
required
skill,
it's
clearly
mentioned
in--as--as
part
of
like
the
job
description
that...
...you're
gonna
be,
umm,
designing
some
web
pages.
umm,
her--her
like
major
does,
a,
fit,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
like
a
broad--it's
pretty
inclusive
in
terms
of
these,
a...
so
as
long
as
it's
not
too,
a,
too
di--you
know,
different.
umm...
yeah,
like
the
third
bullet
on
employment
isn't
real
specific,
umm,
in
addition
to
like
stress
management
media--meditation,
umm,
that
could
be
helpful
in
any
job
setting
probably.
but
it--it
doesn't
really
describe
how
she's
like
certified
in
this
area.
how
is
this
gonna
contribute,
i
guess.
umm.
right.
yeah.
there's
also
no
dates
for
the
employment.
so
it
could
have
been
a
very
short
period
or
the
entire
length
of
her...
...her
undergraduate
career
there,
so.
umm,
strong
gpa
is--is
a
(attractive
though).
right.
i
mean,
this
one
individual,
like
he
did
win
a
couple
scholarships,
but
it
doesn't
say
what
his
gpa
is,
so
we
really
want
to
(get/guess)
mark
(is
that
the
??).
the
governor's
state
scholarship
umm,
we
would
have
to
kind
of
look
those
up
to
see
what
they--like
the
art
competition,
this
does
look
for
some
creativity
in
a
job,
but
like
a
studio
art.
that
could
be
really...
yeah.
yeah,
and
he
has
au--a--a
pretty
good
amount
of--it's
eight
months
of
work
experience
and,
umm,
although
he
was
an
intern...
he
wasn't
like
a
student
employee.
so
i
don't
know,
it's
kind
of
like
almost
professional...
...experience,
i
like
that.
yeah.
yeah.
it
doesn't
list
like
html
skills,
but,
umm,
that's
also
not
explicitly
mentioned
in
the
job
description.
and
if
we
believe
that
he
is
truly
a
motivated
self-starter
with
the
hope
could
grasp
issues
that--that
shouldn't
really
exclude
him,
umm...
but
on
the
other
hand,
sally,
i
guess
she
has
definitely
some--maintain
office
web
site.
so
that
could
be
really
for
sure...
...asking
(???)...
...and
used
that...
yeah,
but...
yeah,
on
the
other
hand...
this
is--this
is
business
administration.
it's
not,
a,
chemistry.
i
mean,
i
think
the
psychology
degree's--say,
for
example,
he
wa--he
was
a
4.0
and
he
did,
you
know,
all
these
social
science
things
like--like
we're
doing
here
now.
so,
umm,
because
like
this
is
such
a
inclusive
list
here,
i
feel
like
it
meshes
pretty
well.
yeah,
but
i...
it--it
implies
that,
but
we
would
be--we
would
be
guessing
there.
we
would
be
speculating
for
sure.
just
like
where
she
doesn't--her
web
site,
a,
it's
a
pretty,
i
feel
like
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
to
think
that,
since
she
doesn't--wasn't
real
specific.
we're--we're
talking
about
her
web
skills,
if
they're
pretty
minimal.
a...
on
the
other
hand,
they
could
be
really
sophisticated
i
guess
too.
umm,
but
likely
she--i
mean,
i--i
going
back
to
your
point
about,
umm,
the
gpa,
but
i
don't
really
know
how,
a,
like
traditional
that
is
to
list
your
gpa.
probably
the
closer
you
are,
the
more
recent
you
are
from
graduating
college,
the
more
your
gpa
is
on
your
resume,
but.
yeah.
i
mean,
based
on
the
information
we
have,
it
makes
it
difficult
'cause
ideally
we
could
just,
a,
ask
'em.
yeah.
'cause
we
are
talking,
umm,
unless
he'd
like
to
quantify
is
good,
because
we
get
in
a
sense
that
sixty
residents,
that's
quite
a
bit.
and
they
have
more,
a,
maybe
like,
that's
more
challenging
maybe
in
a
different
way
than--than
children
five
to
ten.
a
little
different
needs.
(???).
and
train
yeah.
that's
too
bad
because
i
think
he's
actually
a
really
strong
candiate...
...otherwise.
umm,
i
mean,
if
it's...
it
depends
on
how--how
much
this
job
will
involve
like,
umm,
working
with,
a,
people
for
sure.
and
some
of
it
is
like
behind
the
scenes
though
action.
not
all
of
it
is,
a,
like
a
lot
of
it
is
a
the
press
releases,
the
writing,
the,
a,
internet
and
that
type
of...
???
aggressive...
right.
yeah.
plus,
his--the
skills
too
here
it's
listed
each
of
these
points.
you
know,
so,
umm,
otherwi--like
if
it
weren't
for--weren't
for
the
a
typo.
i
think
he'd
be
a
really
strong
candidate
for
this
particular
job.
yeah.
you
could
also
point
out
too
that
it
depends
who
he
raised
the
money
from.
if
he
was
raising
it
from
his
fellow,
a,
peers,
it's
probably
a
lot
of
money.
'cause,
umm.
um--many
students
aren't
really
interested
in
contributing
a
whole
lot.
whereas,
some
people
in
the
older
demographic
are...
you
know,
that
would
be
like
a
real
pale
in
comparison,
but
this
is,
a,
could
be--maybe
he's
really
talented
at
it,
you
know,
umm.
plus,
this
isn't
really
a
job
i
feel
like
that
gpa
is
like
really
crucial
unless
it's
like
below
three.
umm,
it's
like
a
type
of
job
where
like...
...being
really
high
in
like
a
social...
...(???)
like
working
with
people...
that
is
like
paramount.
umm,
gpa
is...
...is
adequate.
right.
for
sure
you
need
a,
a,
i
think
a
bachelor's
degree
just
'cause
it's
so...
...incredibly
common,
but,
umm,
umm,
and
accesible
to
most
people
in
your--'cause
in
your--'cause
assuming,
fortunately,
but.
see
the
problem
with
a
typo
is
that's
such
a,
umm,
our
criticism
is
kinda
of
very,
umm,
it's
not
very
substantive
critism.
it's
like,
you
know,
we're
gonna--.
umm,
we
assume,
maybe,
if
you
were
to
hire
him
that
he
was
gonna
be
more
careful
on---on
the
press
releases,
but
i--a.
it
is
for
sure.
and
it's
very
finance
and
accounting
related
too.
a,
it's
not
really
marketing,
ummm.
yeah.
that's
what--that's
why
the--this
was
put
in
there
i
think
to
make
it
(???)
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
we're
not,
umm,
i
don't
know,
maybe
we
could
say
that
like
jacob
learns
quickly
and
he
has--he
has
the
html,
which,
umm,
maybe
you
could
say
like
is--is,
a,
easy
to--to
pick
up,
but
for
someone
who
has
like
very
little
interest
in--in
learning
it,
or
who,
a,
struggles
with
that.
i
think
it
would
be
like
pretty
insurmountable
obstacle,
but
possibly.
umm,
'cause
this
is
just
like
treasurer.
this
is
just
a
very
finance
and
accounting,
umm,
i
mean,
she
might
be
like
smarter
than
jacob,
but
she's
not
a
!
very
good--as
a
better
match.
she's
not
a
good--good
of
match
for
the
job.
i
don't
think.
it
is
good.
yeah.
i
mean,
the
problem
with
that
too
is--is
we
see--or
we
focus
on--only
on
jacob
right
now,
'cause
we
see
like
comparable,
a...
skills
with
mark.
yeah,
that
was
big.
yeah.
we
know
for
sure
he
has...
...like
power
point
skills.
i
think
i
disagree
with
that,
because
i
think
photoshop
is...
...is
quite,
a,
like
simple
in
comparison
to,
a,
html,
which
is
really
dynamic
and
allows
for
incredible
range
of
abilities.
umm.
'cause
you
can
have
like
really
good
web
pages...
all
the
way
down
to,
a...
yeah,
but
like
photoshop
for
me
is
not
like
the
tipping
point.
i
mean,
umm,
i
would
expect
that
mark
with
the
intellect
he
has
here,
could
easily
conquer
photoshop
with
html
for
certain
that's
yeah.
it's
just
we
don't
know,
but
for
photoshop
we
can
be
certain
he--he
knows
photoshop.
a
(???)...
yeah.
he
(???)...
right.
yeah.
mark
has--has...
...superior
writing
experience.
i
think
definitely.
yeah.
i
mean,
it
would
be--'cause
that's
eight
months,
that
internship,
umm,
it'd
be
nice
if--if
he
like
was,
you
know,
quantified
that
was
more
specific
with
these
speeches.
umm,
how
many
of
them
did
he
proofread
and
edit
versus
how
many
did
he
like
author
himself.
umm...
you
know,
but,
umm,
for
sure
i
think
he's--he
has
better
writing
skills,
but
see
part
of
this
job
too
is
like
presentation
skills
and
like,
you
know,
what
the--whatta--i
guess
i
don't
know
with
the
type--typo
or
not,
but.
yeah.
yeah.
that
seems
fair.
yeah.
at
this
point,
i
think
actually
i--i
could
be
convinced,
but
i'm
sort
of
leaning
towards
mark...
...because...
the
job
description
does
for
sure
emphasize
like
these,
a,
people
skills
that
we
keep
talking
about.
but
a
lot
of
it
is,
a,
the
writing
and,
a...
???
yeah.
yeah.
on
that
particular
point,
he
has
an
edge
i
think
over
jacob.
yeah,
okay.
right.
yeah.
like
service
liaison
between
residents
and
student
affairs
administration.
so
he
was
advocating
for...
...residents
probably.
and,
but
also
listening
to
what
they
say,
you
know.
yeah.
yeah.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
he's
trying
to
be
like
deceptive.
umm,
i
don't
think
he
was
an
official
manager,
i
think
is
basically
what
that
says,
like.
it
very
clearly
says
like,
it
very
clearly
states
that
he
performed
duties
ranging
from
that.
so,
likely
when
the
night
manager
had
the
night
off
or
was
sick
he
would,
a,
kind
of
substitute
and
learn
some
of
those
duties.
but,
umm,
he
didn't
have
the
official
title.
umm,
but
i
mean,
he's
not
a
night
manager,
so
if
he
were
to
put
it
under
work
experience
that
would
be,
a,
over--that
would
be
embellishing
and
like,
this,
a,
characterizing
is--is
a
work
experience.
so,
i--i
mean,
i
think
it's
appropriate
there.
yeah.
like
i
don't
see
that
as
a
very
a--as
a--i
don't
see
it
as
significant,
basically.
yeah.
yeah,
but
we
can't...
...really
umm,
we
have
to
hire
the
people
that
apply.
i
would
say,
a...
mark,
because
of
what
(???)
just
said.
actually,
she
made
a
good
point,
that
seems
like
makes
sense
too
is
that,
umm,
yeah,
for
sure,
like,
there's
less
risk
involved
with,
a,
mark.
like
there's
really
evidence
that,
a,
he
had
the,
a,
professional
experience,
umm,
for,
eight
months.
and,
umm,
i
think,
a,
yeah.
i
think,
umm,
with
jacob,
umm,
yeah.
you
cou--it
could
go,
a,
either
way
if
you
hire
him
even.
yeah,
for
sure.
right.
yeah.
see
that's--that's--that's
what
makes
it
such
a...
...difficult
task,
because
you
want
someone
who's
really
agressive
socially,
i
think
for
this
job.
on
the
other
hand,
umm,
i
keep
looking
at
the
job
description
and
thinking
that
it's
not
quite
as
like,
umm,
emphasizing,
umm,
like
the
social
aspects
as,
a,
as
would
be
a
perfect
ma--it's--it's
like
still
a
better
match
for
mark
because
of
the
presentation.
a,
the
written
skills,
umm.
yeah.
yeah.
just
say
manage
special
events
such
as
sponserships,
parties,
introducing
new
products,
or
relationships,
umm,
to
gain
public
attention.
so
you
do
want
someone
who
will
like
promote,
umm.
yeah.
yeah.
so
you
really
want
someone
really,
a,
extroverted,
but
still
likeable.
not
like
conceited,
of
course,
or
not
like,
umm,
(???).
right.
'cause
this
is
just
designed
to
see
how
we
interact
together,
just
because
like
to--to
get
inside
into
our
decision
making.
just
'cause
like
this
wouldn't
probably
never,
a,
'cause
this
is
when
you--we
wanna
call
the
references
and
ask.
about
what,
how's...
...mark.
umm,
and
meet
the--i
mean,
i
guess
this
goes
without
saying,
but,
umm,
yeah,
to
be
clear--i
don't
know,
i
feel
like
it
is
still
important
to
state
that
you
would
never,
a,
hire
someone
like
this
when--for
the
cost
of
nothing,
you
could
easily
just
meet
them
and
call
their
employers.
umm,
but,
so
it
makes
it
really...
...difficult.
yeah.
i
mean,
these
aren't
sentences
either,
but...
???/sorry.
???
yeah.
'cause
he
picked
out
these
things
from
this
job
description
and
that's
what
he
chose
to
highlight
or
tailor
for
this
particular,
a,
resume
that
he
submitted.
yeah.
yeah.
clearly
with
this
like
he--he
cared,
'cause
he
read
the
job
description
and.
yeah.
umm,
which
shows
like
a
high
le--shows
some
interest
compared
to
a...
...media
relations
executive
is
not--that
takes
a
lifetime
probably
to...
...achieve.
(???).
right.
'cause
it
says
some
of
the
responsibilities
are
write
interesting
and
effective
press
releases
and
prepare
information
for
ads
and/or
media
kits.
yeah.
(???)
yeah.
it's--it's
a
little
bit
busy
i
think
for
sure.
like
with
the
education,
i
mean.
but
i
think
mark's
was
also
a
lot
simpler.
i
mean,
it--it
didn't
show
that
he,
umm,
really
knew
how
to
use
all
the
word
processing
software
very
much,
but...
...but
jacob
showed
that
he,
umm,
had
a
better
comprehension
of
word
processing
software,
even
though
it
wasn't
perfect.
(???)
yeah.
we've
local
as
opposed
to
distant
area
natives.
so,
i
don't
even
know
why
he...
...put
local.
no,
it's
probably
appropriate,
i
guess,
'cause.
they
were
from
the
(???).
yeah.
this
is,
umm,
like
heavy
on
image
and
like
more,
a,
this
attempts
to
be
like
really
emphasize
like
flash
more
than
this
is,
a,
very
substantive
and,
umm,
the
job
description
says,
you
know,
excellent
verbal
and
written
skills.
a,
strong
creative--strong
writing
skills
basically.
he's
very
understated.
he's--he's,
a,
not
as
concerned
about,
a,
appearance,
which,
umm,
which
could
be
sort
of,
a,
difficult
for
this
job,
but...
...umm,
i
think
that's
fine
in
it...
yeah.
right.
yeah,
that's
true.
yeah.
i
mean,
jacob
has
like
a
lot
of
hustle
for
sure.
it's
just
very
aggressive.
he
earned
50
percent
of
educational
expenses.
umm,
he's,
a,
seems
real
persistent,
a,
with
people,
you
know,
i
think.
umm,
so
he'd
be
like
charming
and,
a,
persuasive,
but
this
isn't
sales
as
much
as
it
is,
a,
writing
press
releases,
presentations,
so.
umm.
yeah.
(???)
professional--go
ahead...
yeah,
but
i
mean,
how
many
natives
from
albany,
new
york?
i'm
not
that--that--umm,
let's
not
focus
on
it.
what?
yeah.
i
don't
ev--even
think
mark
is
middle
of
the--of
the
road
in
terms
of
the
resumes
we've
got.
i
think
he's
the--basically
the
best
compared
to
the
resumes
we've
(???).
yeah.
i
mean,
plus,
for
the
required
skills,
they're
all
things
he
basically
already
knows
for
required
skills.
thanks.
so
is
this
more
enjoyable
than
doing
your
online
thing?
