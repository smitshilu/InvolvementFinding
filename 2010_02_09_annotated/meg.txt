these don't work.
thank you.
okay. well, since it's just about 4:30, why don't we get started. we can go through these one by one or we can talk about the guys--the ones you guys have already read--in--from--from what we did online before. it's a little easier i think to go through them one by one, rule them out that way. but, i mean, it's up to you. anybody who has an input. feel free to jump in.
yeah.
well, she doesn't meet the requirement for education, 'cause they ask for a bachelor's degree.
 so i agree with you.
yeah.
as far as resumes go, i like her qualification summary.
 it's out there. i don't know, just--thought that was kinda funny.
yep.
 all in favor say i.
so no rosie. all right.
 how 'bout sally next? she's got a ba in administration, which is good. and a pretty high gpa, which is also important. and she mentions all three of the p.c. skills that are mentioned on the job description. so also a plus.
yeah.
uh huh.
yeah
she also really doesn't have any work experience that's like directly related.
yeah.
yeah.
and then she was a writer for her yearbook, but i don't know if that really qualifies her to write...
a, press releases.
yeah.
yeah.
uh huh.
(???/kids.)
yeah.
that's definite plus.
he still learned...
yeah.
still learn a lot doing internships though.
and he was a res hall--or resident assistant, so he knows how to manage things.
yeah.
definitely.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
but...
he could be io psych, which is industrial organizational.
so it doesn't say what...
yeah.
yeah,
 if he's gotten the dean's list for two semesters that means he had to have at least a 3.5...
...for those two semesters.
yeah.
but...
...that's a good skill.
and he, like--i--going back to the points of like the responsibilities, he's gotta, umm, manage the special events and does that with res hall stuff.
 where, i mean, sally was a camp counselor, so it's like two different sides of the same coin.
but the other thing is, is that he's gonna be working --er, well, whoever we choose, is gonna be working with peers and, i mean, sally's working with children, whereas, mark's working with college age people.
so, i mean, he has to have some sort of--not just like the authority age, but like also like charisma to go along with the...
yeah. 
so should we rule out sally? yes?
yes.
all right. who's next? jacob?
yeah.
yeah. he was ???...
computer skills they asked for. whereas like, sorry, mark doesn't list, a, power point. i mean, which isn't really hard, but, i mean i think if they're asking for it, you should at least tell 'em that you know how to do it.
and i don't know if i necessarily like his work experience compared to mark, because mark was managing people. whereas, jacob's a waiter slash host.
it's not an easy job, but.
yeah.
he had a typo?
oooh, where?
oh, yeah, that's....
that would be a negative.
yeah.
i mean, he does list his gpa.
he's writing and he's got typo on his resume. i mean, how--what's.
and come back once we've gone through everything.
he also does the organizing for the special events. he did the talent show and the sales strategy for--or sales presentation strategy for his fraternity car show. so, i--i think those are both pluses.
yeah.
he also did the informal brochure, which is like part of the press release aspect of it.
yeah.
well, that's his end major gpa, but...
...his overall's a little higher.
i do think education's...
...important though, because he's not gonna learn like, umpf, he's not gonna learn to just fix his typos if he's like got.
yeah.
yeah, but i mean, your resume's really important too. that's how you get your job.
i didn't either,
 but now that i see it...
...it's glaring at me.
yeah.
so why don't we keep both mark and jacob as...
...like potential candidates. talk about pamela.
yeah.
yeah.
 it's looks like it's just a summer internship.
yeah.
but she does present at the trade shows.
any leadership (???).
yeah.
i don't know. she's also, i mean, the dorm room assistant, like i think that's a good thing,
 'cause we said that was good for mark too.
so, i mean, that shows people skills and management skills, because you have to be able to like kind of organize things and keep people in line. so that's one side of it.
okay. everyone in favor of pamela say no.
 i--i'm against her, so.
??? against her. all right. i said that all backwards, but. so it's jacob versus mark. da da da.
 all right. let's go through the pluses of jacob and the minuses. he's got the typo. that's minus.
 but he has a ba in communications.
yeah.
so it's a plus?
but his work experience is only in the summers.
yeah.
i mean, we can go both, back and forth.
yeah.
yeah. i don't know, i don't think the wait staff is really on his side, though.
well, he doesn't have the management experience that mark has. he doesn't have--and in terms of management, i mean like managing...
...people.
i mean, he's got the management training. but that's really i mean, he's got manangement training by organizing a talent show. i don't know if that's really--that's a plus for the special events, but not--he doesn't..
he says it's for the semester at sea.
so.
yeah.
yeah, i actually really disagree with that.
there's online guides for like all of this stuff. so there's easy access to web ???)...
if you don't have it already. and that's like the one thing that makes me like wonder if ...
but mark's...
...it seems like mark has more writing experience.
yeah.
yeah.
well, do we wanna go over the pluses of mark also, like again? i don't know. i don't know what--there's a b--or weigh them against each other. you guys tell me.
well...
sorry. go ahead.
mark was working during the year
 and jacob was only working during the summers.
yeah, but an ra's not easy.
yeah, but it doesn't mean that you don't have ta'--i mean, if--if--if all jacob is doing is working over the summers and participating in his frat stuff. i think that's like the same sort of thing.
but i think that being an ra you have to manage more things. you have to...
... you have to be accountable for your residents and you have to like hold certain events.
well, why don't we go...
...back through the job description, 'cause that'll probably give us our answer.
so, like they want motivated team player. i mean, they're both motivated and they both have people skills. and they want a bachelor's degree in one of the related fields. and mark doesn't have a bachelor's degree in business, or journalism, or commu!
 nication, but it's in psych. which is a good thing or a bad thing depending on where he focused in.
i think so too.
i mean, if they're gonna develop and implement strategies, we see that with mark's more than we see it with jacob's, because mark has to like write, proof, and edit these speeches and press releases, so.
yeah, but we...
...i guess.
yeah.
i mean, the thing about the res hall that goes with this also is that, like, you have to design content for internal and external like media. whether it be web sites or like the programs that he's putting out. like the information!
  that he's providing. and he (???) with information for his residents. so i feel like that's both an internal and external thing. as--like in--in his job, too.
it says they will support the (???) goals of the organization by designing content for internal and external web sites and social media.
so i think that mark's experience lends itself more to internal and external interactions than jacob's does.
yeah.
both sides.
plus, i mean, if he's working, or if he worked with that management intern, then he was working with other people in his office to put forth these press releases and speeches.
i mean, if this was a real short list, we could interview both of them, but...
???
i don--i think they both would be good for the job.
we still got another hour, so we--we can keep talking about this.
sorry, what were you gonna say?
umm.
even with that, that's...
no, i got that feeling too. he's--
i mean, if he's in a frat, i mean.
well, and not to characterize...
...all frat boys...
...(???) a certain way.
a, my ex-roommates were in professional frat...
no, no. i know, but they were in a professional frat and they did the same sort of thing, sort of things as a...
...social frat did.
well, i'm not saying anything bad about it.
but.
but mark's got the social aspect too 'cause...
yeah.
but he says that he developed programs for like he--he--the programs are--are not just like, umm, they can be social events...
...too.
so that's the other thing. it's like.
the product?
i don't know i still feel like mark has the better experience and...
no, go ahead.
umm, yeah.
well, let's just pretend...
...they're on a, on a unreachable island somewhere...
we can't call them. i--a--i--a really--i think jacob would be an o--a better candidate if mark wasn't sitting right next to 'em. i don't know.
yeah, but his summary of qualifications is nice, too. umm, you know, creative, resourceful, and flexible, able to adapt to changing priorities and maintain a positive attitude and strong work ethics. so you can see how that fits into the will it be required in this setting here at the growing e-commerce company. motivated team player, someone who can roll with punches at that,
 umm, whereas jacob doesn't have the--he doesn't even have like a--a few sentences, like a couple...
yeah.
 and it's not even in grammatical, you know, his objective. so, i think this is more like a generic thing and this was specially written for the, umm, job.
uh huh. yeah.
i don't know. i don't think.
and he tailored his application...
...to the job.
yeah.
yeah. well, i mean, as a bullet point it's not terrible, but i think he should have used maybe just--just at least reread it or read it aloud to himself one--once more before submitting it. goal to lead and train and management staff.
yeah.
yeah. well, on that side of it, i mean, he's got--we're gonna be super nitpicky, under his skills like the third hi--like line he's got everything tabbed over in the lines before, the second part of it is not in line. you know, it just looks a little messy to me. and if you're gonna be creating a press releases, then i think you might want it to look a little neater.
yeah.
i don't know i think...
i think the language is offensive.
partier.
guy.
yeah.
yeah. umm, i don't know, i think the fact that mark has all these scholarships. i mean, he doesn't have his gpa listed, which is definitely.
yeah.
but he does have...
...creativity aspect in the hallmark award competition.
the art competition.
yeah. it's not as busy.
yeah.
i don't know. i feel like jacob's got this pamphlet for the brochure for the apartment leasing ocmpany, but then mark's got all the, umm, speeches, press releases from his inte!
 rnship. plus, the stuff that he did with the res hall. i think that's--i think he's probably got more stuff to show us. that he's prepared for the job itself.
that's the other thing that i--like it's kind of good that you can't meet these people for a fake job. because jacob might come in here and be like all charming and like, no, i'll--i'll be super good at this job. and mark might be a little shier, but he might be the better candidate, because of his work experience and hi!
 s training.
yeah.
yeah.
plus, the parties, i mean, they're not supposed to be like crazy keggers.
i think we're all in agreed...
no. no. go ahead. i'd like to hear.
oh, yeah.
humm, i don't know, i think the rest of them had parts of it. and it seems like mark and jacob have it all, but in differing degrees.
like the (???) candidate.
yeah.
i think mark's the guy.
i think we're all agreed.
he does.
and you can learn the other computer skills that he doesn't necessarily have.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
and i think, all right, mark's it. yea.
 should we discuss anything else?
okay.
yeah. i don't know, i kind of liked sally's, just 'cause she's the massage therapist. so she's gotta have the people skills for massage therapist.
coulda been much worse. these--these jobs, i mean, i mean, some of the resumes that we had for the other jobs that we were deciding on online, that was during the last session, they're like really hard to choose because the canidates were like so closely matched.
that it was just like--like one person didn't like it because of, like something really ridiculous and the other person didn't like him because he was a boy or something like that. really random things to argue over. glad we all agreed.
makes life a lot easier.
only twenty after five.
this definitely giving me things to think about for my own resume.
i think we can take these off.
umm, yes. (???) the internet. so it's not so--i mean, i'd--i'd be typing up stuff (???).
yeah. i'd do it.
