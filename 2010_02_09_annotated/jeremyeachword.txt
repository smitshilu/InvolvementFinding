thanks.
yeah.
thanks.
yeah
i
assume
we--are
we
ruling
that
one
out
then?
i
yeah,
that's--that's
right.
yeah.
jacob
was
my
personal
favorite.
out
of
like
all
the
other
resumes,
they
seemed
kind
of
bland
to
me,
but
i
really
like
how
he
has
all
this
a,
this--all
these
people
skills
listed.
i
mean,
what
i
got
from
just
glancing
over
the
job
description
was
they
want
someone
to
really
rep
their
company.
they
want
them
to
be
face...
...and
this
is
like
a
young
kid,
he
was
in
a
fraternity,
did
all
this,
a,
he--all
this,
a,
like,
a--a
events
and,
umm,
shows
that
he
p--and
so
he
was
pretty
much,
a,
the
one
i
liked
the
best.
and
he
had
those
computer
skills.
???
at
some
point
yeah.
i
mean,
this
is
word,
word
and
excel
for
mark.
oh,
yeah.
humpf.
yeah.
yeah.
other
than
that,
i
don't
see
too
many
people--other
people
skills.
ra.
i
think
it's
one
thing
to
deal
with
your
peers,
like
kids
your
age.
but
then
when
you--with
jacob,
where
he's
dealing
with
other
people,
not
just
students.
i
think
it's
different
in
my
eyes.
yeah.
i
was
kinda
of
hoping
to
see
more
like
you
could
say
you're
an
ra,
but
you
can
just
sit
in
your
room
and
like,
a,
deal
with
like
academ--or,
a,
a,
like
judicial
problems
with
your--with
your,
a,
residents.
but
she
didn't
really,
a,
say
that
too
much
about
like
what
programs
they
hosted.
or
like
what
things
they
did
in
their
common
rooms
or
something.
so
ra,
what--to
what
depth?
yeah.
take
her
out.?
yeah.
yeah.
absolutely.
it's
tough,
so.
what,
that
he
didn't
like,
project
himself
more
into
taking
a
better
job?
or
a
think
about
that.
management.
okay.
like
with
the
html
skills,
isn't
say
what
he
used
them
for
as
like,
but
still
his
computer
skills
are
a
little,
umm,
deeper
maybe
more
than--than
mark.
yeah.
humpf.
to
me
it
boils
down
to,
a,
jacob--they
both
have
a
good
amount
of
experience.
jacob
seems
to
have
like
a
more
social
experience.
while
mark's...
...a
experience
is
more
formal.
he
has
that,
a,
a
good
internship
and,
a,
the
ra.
i
like
how
he
elaborated
on
that.
programs,
advice,
60
residents,
that's
impressive.
so...
i'm
looking
at
the,
a,
the
bullets
under
responsibilities,
include,
but
are
not
limited
to.
a,
the,
a,
four
little
stars
there,
i
think,
a,
mark
takes
it
on
the
first
three
and
jacob
may
have
an
advantage
on
the
last
one.
although,
mark
doesn't
really
tout
his,
a,
social
abilities
or,
kind
of
a
downfall
just
looking
at
paper
instead
of
interviewing
'em.
but,
a,
i
think,
a,
mark
kinda
takes
it
there.
yeah.
there
you
go.
oh,
yeah,
absolutely.
i
think
they
have--both
have
their
pros
and
cons,
but
when
it
comes
down
to
one.
all
right.
do
you
wanna
go
around
the
table
and
just
pick
who
you
like
the
best?
okay.
yeah.|
maybe
it
was
'cause
it
was
night
he
didn't
really
do
that
much.
so
he
didn't
really
consider
it.
and
maybe
that
speaks
on
his
char..
...on
his
part
then
for
not
putting
it.
right.
parties.
humpf.
yeah.
so
equal
parts
like
hypeman
and
part
like
manager
too.
yeah.
humpf.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
this
is
like...
yeah.
well,
laid
out.
uh
huh.
absolutely.
yeah.
a,
mark's
a
safer
bet
from
just
looking
at
these
two.
yeah.
it's
not
like
crazy
parties.
the
terminology.
yeah.
yeah.
i
like
mark.
he
has
his
core
skills
there,
the
professionalism.
and
if
you
strip
away
like
the
social
stuff,
'cause
you
can't
really
judge
that.
i
mean,
you
can
really
say
anything.
or
i
mean
on--in
their
resumes,
when
you
take
away,
a,
what
they
say
about
their
social
skills,
when
you--you
have
that,
the
core
skills
that
they
built
in
their
undergrad.
i
like
what
i
see
with
mark.
yeah.
we
don't
even
know
the
level
of
the
computer
skills
that,
a,
jacob
has.
that's
a
good
point,
yeah.
and
they
only
say
word,
power
point,
excel.
so
if
you
really--if
you
take
out
html,
i
mean,
the
web
site's
probably
gonna
be
there
and
they
probably
already
have
the
infrastructure
of
the
web
site.
so
you're
just
gonna
be
updating
with
text.
you
can
see
mark
has
the
better
writing
skills.
they
both
know
microsoft
word.
so,
then
it
wo!
rks
better.
yeah,
the
award.
exactly.
it
was
shoo,
shoo.
really?
humm.
how
long
did
that
take?
oh.
thanks.
yeah.
