Ah,
hello
That
took
a
little
while
to
get
in....
Hey
michael
What
have
I
missed?
like
that
she
mentions
"the
child's
needs
and
well-being"
Are
we
going
through
the
resumes
in
order?
"reputed"?
think
he
means
"reputable"
don't
see
much
qualification
for
position
on
his
resume...
By
way
-
do
job
title
open
position???
The
posting
asks
experience
but
doesn't
specify
what
exactly
OK
afterschool
counselor
sounds
good
So
tutoring
really
cover
would
be
doing
"Volunteerism
Leadership"
yes,
lacks
Emily

:)
it's
funny,
her
listing
"objective"
makes
me
feel
is
more
interested
never
liked
an
objective

own

maybe
she's
