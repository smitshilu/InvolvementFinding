Hello.
Hi
Sarah's
name
has
been
going
between
blue
and
gray
on
my
screen...maybe
she
is
working
through
some
computer
problems?
Oh,
hope
she
finds
the
cat.
george:
yeah,
a
lot
of
them
snuck
in
that
computer
skills
info
again
tonight,
though.
Actually
a
computer
expert
at
the
Y
would
be
nice...I
tried
to
change
my
address
to
one
outside
Albany
the
other
day
but
the
guy
at
the
desk
said
the
computer
system
refused
the
zip
code,
heh.
Yeah,
would
be
nice
if
it
said
they
are
managing
an
after
school
class
or
sitting
in
an
office
to
counsel
youth
with
problems
or
what....
Man
the
desk
today,
plan
a
kids
program
for
the
summer
the
next
day,
handle
a
program
in
person
the
next?
I
could
see
that,
I
guess.
A
lot
of
the
staffers
at
the
Y
seem
to
do
both
training
in
the
weight
rooms
and
regular
job
stuff
from
what
I've
seen.
Not
sure
who
handles
those
more
community
oriented
rooms
with
computers
and
meeting
tables
and
the
kitchen
and
whatnot
in
the
back,
though.
Still
here.
Hmm,
well
the
fundraising
experience
has
got
to
be
less
applicable
than
the
nanny
or
child
care
at
least.
Even
if
the
exact
job
tasks
aren't
clear.
Hmm,
yeah,
no
nick
any
more.
I
guess
we
should
just
start,
not
wait
for
nick
and
Sarah?
Fundraising
was
Mark,
Nanny
was
Carla,
I
think,
if
you
were
talking
about
my
comment.
Sure.
Ha,
yeah,
when
I
hear
nanny
I
think
someone
older.
My
parents
always
told
me
not
to
ride
the
horses
on
the
paved
roads,
it
hurts
their
feet
or
something.
Annoying
considering
more
and
more
roads
are
paved
here,
ha.
Hi
nick.
We
just
started
reviewing
Carla's
resume.
george
was
wondering
how
old
she
was,
amy
noticed
she
graduated
high
school
in
'06.
I
do
like
how
she
mentioned
tutoring
in
the
nanny
job
description,
though.
That's
more
in
line
with
the
"committed
to
making
a
positive
difference"
part
of
the
job
description
in
my
mind
then
the
applicant
who
just
put
something
like
child
care
services.
than*
even.
Heh,
01234....I
remember
talking
to
someone
who
processed
surveys
at
IBM
and
he
had
a
bunch
of
numbers
people
often
entered
as
fake
data.
"123
Street",
etc..
Yeah,
I
guess
our
group
is
older.
Sounds
good.
Hi
meg.
meg:
we
just
finished
going
through
Carla's
resume
and
are
moving
on
to
Richard.
Hmm,
"flexible
schedule",
that's
a
plus.
No
complaints
when
asked
to
work
the
odd
weegeorged
shift.
Manning
a
telephone
gets
some
communication
points.
Multi-tasking
too,
since
you
get
them
randomly.
Charity
quiz
might
be
worth
some
points
towards
"committed
to
making
a
positive
difference",
I
guess.
Yeah,
all
of
them
seem
to
be
in
progress
on
degrees.
I
guess
one
had
a
BA.
meg:
what
exactly
does
that
entail?
Do
they
manage
a
group
or
kids?
Or
are
they
just
available
for
kids
with
problems?
group
of
kids*,
typo,
sorry.
Ah,
that
helps,
thanks.
I
was
thinking
like
my
high
school
guidance
counselor,
ha.
Hi
mara.
mara
we've
been
reviewing
resumes
in
order.
Carla
and
Richard
so
far.
mara:*
even.
Fund
raising
gives
some
points
for
communication
and
outgoing
at
least.
I'd
much
rather
experience
with
the
age
group,
though,
yeah.
Volunteering
and
child
care
experience,
better.
That's
a
good
point.
Seeing
all
those
expected
degrees
the
candidates
have
makes
me
think
they
are
going
to
leave
once
they
graduate.
A
communications
degree
might
teach
you
to
be
sensitive
around
the
various
ethnic
and
religious
issues
that
come
up
with
a
large
group
of
people
at
least.
Hmm,
is
he
the
only
one
with
a
complete
degree
so
far?
Discussions,
lectures,
grading
papers,
drama
club...he
seems
to
have
communication
related
plusses.
Good
point.
I
guess
the
only
relevant
degree
I
see
is
the
Psychology
one.
Yeah,
even
Robert
is
working
on
another
one,
so
I
can't
use
his
complete
as
an
argument
for
him
not
leaving
once
he
finished
a
degree.
Richard
is
the
one
with
the
Psychology
degree
as
well
In
progress
anyway.
Tutoring
in
the
age
group
we're
interested
in.
flexible
schedule.
new
filing
system
->
self
starter?
Handling
calls
should
count
as
multi-tasking
points
too,
they
interrupt,
you
get
multiple
sometimes,
etc..
So
Carla
and
Emily
are
the
other
two
options...
Hmm,
Carla
has
some
good
communication
points
I
didn't
notice
the
first
time
around:
facilitated
meetings,
liaison,
acting
as
a
rep..
Nanny
experience
is
the
bigger
plus,
though.
Even
if
it
is
a
year
outside
our
range.
Organized
events
might
count
for
self-starter,
politics
for
the
sort
of
person
who
would
be
"committed
to
making
a
positive
difference".
The
Albany
Y
has
a
pool.
Maybe
they'd
kick
the
swimmers
out
and
have
the
life
guard
do
the
CPR,
heh.
It
is
kind
of
funny
to
put
"teenage"
on
the
resume
for
a
job
that
references
younger
kids
too.
If
it
is
a
big
program,
meg
mentioned
80
in
her
example,
there
might
be
room
for
her
to
work
with
just
the
older
kids.
I
did
notice
there
was
one
Albany
contact
address
in
there...Emily.
She
might
be
more
familar
with
the
school
systems
or
something,
I
guess.
I'll
vote
Carla,
it
would
be
nice
to
call
her
and
Richard
up
at
least,
though.
tutoring...
telephones
I'm
still
for
Carla.
Richard:
george,
meg,
michelle.
Carla:
mara,
michael,
amy.
3-3?
I
was
going
by
george's
"george
(9:46:25
PM)
i
think
richard
has
my
vote
now"
comment.
Sounds
good.
michelle:
we
could
argue
that
next
session,
ha.
Good
night.
