Ah,
hello
That
took
a
little
while
to
get
in....
Hey
michael
What
have
I
missed?
I
like
that
she
mentions
"the
child's
needs
and
well-being"
Are
we
going
through
the
resumes
in
order?
"reputed"?
I
think
he
means
"reputable"
I
don't
see
much
qualification
for
the
position
on
his
resume...
By
the
way
-
do
we
have
a
job
title
for
the
open
position???
The
posting
asks
for
experience
but
doesn't
specify
in
what
exactly
OK
afterschool
counselor
sounds
good
So
tutoring
doesn't
really
cover
what
the
counselor
would
be
doing
I
like
that
he
mentions
"Volunteerism
and
Leadership"
yes,
he
lacks
experience
Emily
wins!!!!!!
:)
it's
funny,
but
her
listing
the
"objective"
makes
me
feel
she
is
more
interested
in
the
position
-
and
I
have
never
liked
listing
an
objective
on
my
own
resume!
taht's
a
good
point
-
maybe
she's
beena
full-time
student?
yep,
i'm
a
spelling
Nazi
not
counting
chat,
of
course....
I
would
nominate
Emily
and
Carla
as
finalists
Carla
is
CPR/First
Aid
Certified,
which
could
be
very
valuable
Yes,
george
The
tribe
has
spogeorge
"reputed
company"
still
bothers
me
-
that's
bad
English
I
would
vote
against
him,
since
we
have
two
others
we
like
She
volunteered
the
the
Red
Cross
*for
CPR/first
aid
is
more
important
<crickets>
Debbie
Downer
Haven't
we
reached
a
decision?
I
thought
we
already
had
a
unanimous
vote???
Carla
is
working
for
the
family
in
Albany
OK
let's
have
htem
both
in
for
interviews
*them!
