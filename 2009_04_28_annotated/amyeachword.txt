Hello!
An
email
just
came
in
from
meg
that
she
won't
be
here
on
time
that
leaves
mara
and
Yuan
possibly
coming
later
also
Hi
nick
yeah,
in
another
job
that
requires
People
Skills!
thats
true
george-
a
benefit
hehe
i
think
the
job
descrip
is
lacking
tonight
itdoesnt
ally
say
what
you'd
be
doing-
counselor,
etc.
Just
says
working
with
7-14
shall
we
assume
it
means
working
directly
with
that
age
group
opposed
to
working
just
a
desk
type?
communication
skills,
be
outgoing
and
a
self-starter
and
able
to
multi-task
well,
how
bout
we
based
the
resumes
on
these
qualities
they
are
looking
for....
and
work
with
kids
of
course
but
there
are
camps
run
out
of
Ys
also
and
child
care
hello?
everyones
names
just
disappeared...
and
back
who
we
looking
at?
resume?
sure
gotcha-
so
that
is
not
he
most
important
to
get
this
job....
sorry
about
my
typos-
not
used
to
this
laptop
yet
wanna
go
thru
carlas
resume
first
?
'06
high
school
grad
yeah
only
less
than
a
year
as
part-time
nanny
thats
what
i'm
here
for!
:)
hi
there
nick
well
that
is
a
considerate
thought
for
the
horses
her
only
other
exp
is
less
than
a
year
also
in
high
school
wait
a
sec-
now
i
see
that
her
college
info
says
MA
'08
yes
michael-
she
described
what
she
did
a
little
yeah
nick-
it
says
a
little
about
her
exp
with
the
child-
rather
than
just
saying
nanny
yeah
its
not
completely
related
especially
bc
she
only
worked
with
one
child
and
not
a
group
which
the
Y
might
require-
Might
being
the
key
word
k
who
is
next
Hi
meg
oh
good!
poor
kitty
his
best
part
is
that
he
tutored
in
grades
3-5
but
doesnt
say
for
how
long...and
he
is
in
a
Psych
program
in
college
haha
minus
points
so
far!
i
like
him
better
than
carla
already
7-14
is
what
they
are
looking
for
so
thats
not
so
bad
flexibility
part
is
good
too
michael
looks
like
hes
a
freshman
nope-
big
problem
nick
yeah
that
makes
it
difficult
to
hire
the
right
person
without
knowing
what
we're
hiring
for-
but
we
figure
someone
who
can
work
with
kids
overall
sure
george
hi
mara!
no
child
exp-
was
part
of
college
orientation
worst
resume
yet
he
has
some
leadership
skills
though
and
yes,
communication
i
dont
know
that
they
do
homework
in
this
position
though-
ok-
we
have
an
impressioon
of
him
so
lets
move
on...we
will
go
back
after
we
hit
all
of
them
??
hehe
why
dont
these
people
state
how
long
they've
done
a
job???
i
like
how
she
has
some
volunteer
experience-
although
nothing
child
related
necessarily
they
are
made
up
resumes
george
hahaha
she
is
better
than
some
others
nothing
relevant
to
the
job-
he
doesnt
earn
any
pts
with
me
untlize
Lol
he
def
just
needs
a
job...not
looking
for
the
experience
the
job
descrip
does
say
"exp
preferred"
so
exp
or
a
relevant
degree
should
be
ok
emily
or
richard
are
on
my
list
maybe
we
should
weight
the
pros
of
each-
like
a
point
system
then
we
can
get
an
answer
yes
george
lets
list
richards
good
points
to
get
it
all
straightened
out...
psych
degree
in
progress...
communication
skills-
answered
calls
from
public
maybe
interests
means
he
wasnt
paid?
yeah
the
spelling
is
not
the
best
thing
fora
resume...but
our
choices
are
not
so
good
as
it
is
nick
i
like
the
psych
degree
i
think
we
covered
him
pretty
well....
lets
move
onto
emily
awesome
meg@
!
she
has
child
care
listed
which
is
good
(but
doesnt
say
for
how
long)
relief
work
at
ARC
seems
pretty
good
3
pts?
yeah
richard
is
better
than
emily
repute
so
Carla....the
moment
of
truth....
but
in
high
sschool?
i
would
def
interview
carla
and
richard
to
find
out
how
much
exp
with
kids
they
have
5
pts
for
carla?
i'm
good
with
that
i'm
speaking
but
you
cant
hear
me
yay
for
carla
any
kind
of
child
care
service
is
high
turnover....
at
least
you
have
someone
there
for
a
timebeing
who
enjoys
it
and
can
offer
somethign
to
the
kids
she
might
change
her
mind
and
like
the
younger
kids
and
not
go
for
a
teens
job!
:)
nooooo
lol
theres
a
website
for
coinflipping!
hahaha
i
think
either
one
would
be
ok
i
think
carla
is
fine
bc
she
might
like
working
with
younger
kids
better
after
the
exp
at
the
Y
i'm
for
Carla
george
Ssshhhhh
oh
no!
meg!
everyone,
state
your
verdict!
but
if
they
are
all
here
for
college...they
might
be
libing
here
including
summers
living
nope-
carla
is
my
choice
link
LOL!
by
the
way
men
and
women
are
equal
with
caring
for
children
depends
on
the
person
hehehe
i
lost
track
me
too
mara-
hehe
to
be
honest.....
companies
never
choose
only
one
candidate
anyway,
so
i
think
we
are
fine
with
choosing
both
richard
and
carla
hunted?
hunter?
what
are
we
talking
about
here
let
me
make
one
more
point
if
i
can....
where
in
richards
resume
do
you
see
him
working
WITH
people?
carla
-->
child
care,
facilitated
meetings,
worked
with
other
officers,
liiason
but
phone
calls
are
not
with
people
face
to
face
he
tutored
but
that
seems
the
only
face
to
face
interaction
other
than
being
in
an
office
handling
calls
true
not
really
george
:P
Carla!!
but
carla
had
child
care
exp
lol
3!!
Carla=
jen,
michael,
mara
meg
is
a
troublemaker
in
online
world!
hehehe
good
answer
meg
calling
george
and
nick
you
are
needed
in
HR
YAY!
Thanks
george
hehe
And
nick?
i
think
we
have
our
winner
since
its
close
tp
closing
time
sorry
meg-
i
appreicate
your
perserverance!
Boy
this
was
exhausting
i
think
we
are
done
for
the
night
i
think
we're
set
for
the
night
Night

back
Thurs
LOL
