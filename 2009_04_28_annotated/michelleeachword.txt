complete
degree
might
not
be
very
important
here
his
schedule
is
flexible
I
agree
with
nick
Richard
is
good
too.
yeah,
george
psych
degree
could
be
a
plus
how
many
points
the
others
got?
So
Emily...
between
psych
degree
and
CPR/First
aid
certified,
which
one
is
more
important
here?

I
am
reconsidering
Carla
because
of
the
teenage
counselor
thing.
Hehe
Richard!
I
think
we
need
to
have
a
photo
of
each
applicant
:-)
Richard..
If
we
have
budget,
we
can
also
interview
Emily
me
too
then
Emily
handling
calls
we
need
reference
from
the
applicants
too
richard

who
will
interview
Carla?
good
night
