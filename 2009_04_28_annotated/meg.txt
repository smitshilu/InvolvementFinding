Hi all
Sorry i am so late!
Hi
My cat was missing, sorry!
We found him
How are we doing this?
He was hiding under the neighbor's stairs
:(
Ok, 
and yes
He's a big baby and can
not handle outdoors
He graduated 10th in his class though
+1?
out of 170
But he did tutor
So wait, is he -2 right now?
He doesn't list his GPA though
Which makes me think that he might be partying too much as a freshman
Probably care-taker
my room mate works for the Y as an afterschool councelor?
So probably something like that
Experience in child care probably
She works with a group of kids, managing about 80 altogether with a staff of about 10 people, they have to do gym time, spend time outdoors or do homework
I got it:)
And they have rules about no running, etc...
(In the halls)
moderator just messaged me on gmail and said its "child counselor"
The position
Hi mara
I was late too- its not hard to catch u[
*p
Exactly
We're going though the resume's and choosing the right person for the job- we did the first 2 already
(Or well, I missed the first one lol)
He has no experience
I agree
Yeah but if they're looking for someone who is experienced then I'd cross him off
Sounds good
Hahaha
I like hers so far
She has experience
But she's VERY vague
I think that she's the best
It does
My old roomie was there
True
True
Ok, I looked ahead and Robert Jordan is already off the list.
He spelled utilize wrong.
LOL\
I know... good writer
But fictional getting a job RJ not so good
Emily is 2011
Not to work with kids, if their degree is completely unrelated
English? Nahh
I think that Emily Brown is our girl
She has communication skills
Umm, he wasn't as good
I kind of do too
but she wants to work with teenagers
and its for younger kids
I dunno, I'm torn between Richard
, Carla
 and Emily
Yeah
She had more intensive care
Mark and
 Robert are the weakest links.
Goodbye!
Hahaha
Good plan
Psych degree=+1
Self starter with volunteer experience
+1
So he's at like 4
No organizing charity quiz that raised money
I think he had 4 total
Hahaha I'm counting
Communication degree
Woops
I'm redundant
lol
Ok Emily is out
CPR certified
Concentration in psych in hs
She's still learning about it?
Kind of
CPR
But richard could always get certification after he's hired
Yeah
Hahaha
I third that
Carla wins
That could work
Nope
Carla wins:)
The only problem I forsee:
Is that she wants to work with teens she might quit after a short time period
?
BAD NEWS BEARS
Hahahaha
Sorry guys
:-P
I think Carla is the right choice
h
ahahaha
I'm turning people to the dark side
Hahaha I can't tell if youi're being sarcastic or not
Not yet!
:)
We toss a coin
Yesss!
And the meg
Heads=Carla, Tails=Richard
I'm for richard...
:(
Oh nooo
Oh that actually makes sense
Then I might be willing to concede the point
*ceed?
Idk
That's not true!
Men can be good with kids too
Hahaha now we look at them!
Awww. Don't pick on the guys:-P
He's got experience with youngsters
-Richard-
Thanks george
Thanks george
So is carla still winning?
I'm still for richard
Unless he's really ugly
Hahaha
And then he'd scare the kids
:-P
Since we need pics
Hahaha
You know fictional richard?
Lol
Probably
I think its a hunter (therefore male) position
Although my profs would kill me for that
Men and women both hunted in hunter-gatherer societies
But everyone thinks of 'man-the-hunter'
s
sweet
Thanks george
:)
Ok so thats 3 for richard
then we should start over
Ok
and telephone calls
Hahahaha george- is that because you moved last week
But tutoring little kids is and that is who he'd be working with
and organizing charity quiz
thats gotta have interaction
I still vote for richard but the wrestling mtch is a good idea
RICHARD
What about nick?
george?
nick?
C'mos!
*C'mon
Lets go for RICHARD:D
Hahaha
Not a trouble maker:)
Just a devil's advocate
lol
0:-)

Oh the horror!
The anguish!
Ohhhh the insanity!
