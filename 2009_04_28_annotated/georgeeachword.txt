good
evening
we
get
to
hire
someone
else
tonight!
haha
7
to
14
year
olds
need
plenty
of
computer
counseling
who
knows...perhaps
they
need
help
with
their
spread
sheets
near
income
tax
time!
perhaps
by
multi-task
they
mean
do
multiple
tasks?
:o
like
a
multi-purpose
job;
whatever
needs
to
get
done?
yea,
it
is
a
strange
description
so
we
prefer
experience
filling
an
unspecific
ambiguous
role!
yeah,
same
here
i
think
when
someone
enters
or
exits,
all
the
names
disappear
momentarily
that
last
one
might
have
been
nick
leaving
ok
sure
i
wonder
how
old
carla
is
she's
got
a
perfect
driving
record
and
rides
horses!
coincidence?
i
think
she
rides
a
horse
and
not
a
car!
ah
good
eye,
amy
hello
i
think
carla
might
have
got
her
zip
code
wrong
i
don't
know
much
about
child
development,
but
care
for
6
year
olds
may
only
partially
overlap
with
our
7-14
age
group
going
in
order
sounds
good
to
me
hi
meg
richard
anderson
ohh
richard
says
our
company
is
reputed...one
point
for
him!
is
he
an
indoor
cat?
oh,
good
catch...let's
take
that
point
away!
grades
3-5
is
typically
9-11
year
olds
i
think
strangely
enough
carla's
unclear
background
fits
our
unclear
ad
:P
high
school
was
3.8
tho
nick
asks
a
good
question
would
anybody
like
to
move
on?
i
think
we
probably
mentioned
everything
on
richard's
app
hi
mara
*=*=Mark
Stewart=*=*
teaching
kids
how
to
fight
back
against
the
school
bully
yup,
we're
on
mark
stewart
now
he
might
be
able
to
help
with
biology
homework!
haha
mara,
i
was
going
to
mention
how
i
like
how
he
puts
photoshop
at
the
end
like
he
was
thinking
"...oh
yeah,
can't
forget
photoshop"
i
wonder
what
emily
has
been
up
to
between
2003
and
2011
er...now
rather
than
2011
:P
robert
jordan
wrote
wheel
of
time
tho
:(
would
you
prefer
someone
with
a
complete
degree?
richard
has
actually
worked
with
children
in
our
age
group
tho
9
to
11
yr
olds
nobody
seems
to
disagree
that
mark
and
robert
are
bottom
2
k
btw...richard
put
his
tutoring
under
interests
actually
reputed
is
a
real
word
apparently
:o

:P
carla
vs
richard
showdown!
uh
oh,
richard
down
for
the
count!
yea,
carla
seems
like
a
good
choice
you
were
rooting
for
carla,
mara?
uh
oh...does
richard
re-enter
the
fray?
richard,
bloodied
and
hobbling
but
not
done!
to
richard's
credit,
he
has
more
experience
right
in
the
middle
of
our
age
group
of
7-14
i
think
carla's
losing
support
from
the
amy
and
the
george!
does
it
matter
they
live
in
MA?
hmm...i
would
never!
amy
is
flip
flopping!
wait...i
can't
tell
who's
in
the
lead
anymore
concede
is
correct
i
believe
that
one
florida
teacher
who
had
a
kid
with
a
14
yr
old
student...:o
lol
michelle
is
this
a
hunter
or
gatherer
position?
you're
welcome!
i
think
richard
has
my
vote
now
me
and
meg
need
to
find
out
how
ugly
he
is
what
if
carla
is
ugly
too
tho
how
about
we
interview
carla
first
to
see
if
she's
hot
that's
because
we
men
have
the
muscle
to
lug
the
carcass
back
to
camp!
you're
welcome!
does
anybody
else
think
carla
and
emily
should
have
an
oil
wrestling
match
for
the
position?
yea
he
tutored
haha
meg
i
feel
like
being
a
trouble
maker
and
saying
richard
but
i
really
feel
carla
is
better
slightly
so
carla
hey
i
voted
carla,
not
richard!
i
picked
carla...did
i
mess
up?
mara,
you
are
confusing
me
now!
must
be
lag
ok
guys
was
fun...good
night!
